President's Letter

Dear Shareholder,

Over the past several years, many investors experienced positive returns across
most major asset classes. However, 2015 was a tale of two markets, with
favorable market conditions in the first half of the year, followed by an abrupt
slowdown and increased volatility beginning in August. The global markets were
challenged by significant economic cross-currents in different geographic
regions and industrial sectors. While the U.S. economy gradually improved,
growth slowed in China. Emerging markets struggled following a decline in
commodity prices, especially oil. While lower energy prices are good for the
consumer, there were ripple effects throughout the global economy.

Against this backdrop, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose by just 1.4% in
2015, international equity markets were essentially flat, and emerging market
equities fell sharply. Across U.S. fixed-income sectors, U.S. government and
investment-grade corporate bonds were fairly flat for the year, while high-yield
bonds, as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Master II High Yield
Index, posted a -4.9% total return.

Entering 2016, we see the possibility of a cyclical upswing, against an overall
economic backdrop that remains fragile and points towards structurally lower
growth. As always in a Presidential election year, political rhetoric has the
potential to impact U.S. sectors such as health care in 2016. Economies around
the world in both developed and emerging markets are experiencing deep
structural change. Geopolitical instability on many fronts, the rising risk of
policy mistakes, and market liquidity issues all increase the possibility of
sharp swings in asset values. In this environment, financial markets remain
vulnerable to unusual levels of volatility. While divergences among regions and
industries is an important theme, we are generally optimistic about the outlook
for the U.S. economy, which we expect will see modest growth.

Throughout Pioneer's history, we have believed in the importance of active
management. In periods of market volatility, we believe that the value of active
management is even more compelling. Our experienced and tenured investment teams
focus on identifying value across global markets using proprietary research,
careful risk management, and a long-term perspective. Our ongoing goal is to
produce compelling returns consistent with the stated objectives of our
investment products, and with our shareowners' expectations. We believe our
shareowners can benefit from the experience and tenure of our investment teams
as well as the insights generated from our extensive research process.

<PAGE>

As always, and particularly during times of market uncertainty, we encourage you
to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall investment plan that
addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to implement such a plan in
a disciplined manner.

We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in us and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ Lisa M. Jones

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/15

Floating-rate loan investments struggled during the final months of the 12-month
period ended November 30, 2015, after producing healthier results in earlier
months. In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that
affected the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the 12-month
period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a portfolio manager at Pioneer,
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q    How did the Trust perform during the 12-month period ended November 30,
     2015?

A    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 1.96% at net asset value and 1.31% at
     market price during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2015, while the
     Trust's benchmark, the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
     Index), returned -1.06% at net asset value. Unlike the Trust, the Barclays
     Index does not use leverage. While the use of leverage increases investment
     opportunity, it also increases investment risk. During the same 12-month
     period, the average return (at market price) of the 22 closed end funds in
     Lipper's Loan Participation Funds category (which may or may not be
     leveraged) was -3.16%.

     The shares of the Trust were selling at an 11.95% discount to net asset
     value on November 30, 2015.

     The Trust's standard, 30-day SEC yield was 5.39% at the end of the fiscal
     year on November 30, 2015, compared with a standard 30-day SEC yield of
     5.35% for the Trust as of May 31, 2015, the end of the previous semiannual
     reporting period*.

Q    How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
     12-month period ended November 30, 2015?

A    Floating-rate loan investments generated slightly positive returns during
     most of the period's early months, but the market environment became less
     supportive over the final months of the period when a series of
     developments undermined investor confidence.

     The period had actually begun on a rocky note in December 2014, a month in
     which floating-rate loans generated negative returns. However, the first
     five months of 2015 featured an improved environment as demand for loans
     increased, driven by factors such as the market's confidence in both the
     health of the domestic economy and the credit-worthiness of bank loans. In

*    The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
     hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
     Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

     addition, there was widespread anticipation among market participants that
     interest rates soon would start to increase, a move that would benefit the
     performance of bank-loan investments.

     Beginning in June 2015, however, investor confidence began to wane in
     response to a number of unsettling situations, including yet another debt
     crisis in Greece, dramatic declines in world oil prices that raised doubts
     about global demand, and evidence of slowing economic growth in China. In
     addition, the decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Fed) not to
     raise short-term interest rates in both June and September 2015 created
     uncertainty about when interest rates would actually begin to climb. Over
     the final six months of the period, the Trust's benchmark, the Barclays
     Index, returned -3.04% (-1.07% in November, the period's final month).
     Meanwhile, the Trust returned -1.34% at net asset value and -4.20% at
     market price over the final six months of the period (-0.82% and -0.73%,
     respectively, for the month of November).

Q    Which of your investment decisions had the biggest effects on the Trust's
     benchmark-relative performance during the 12-month period ended November
     30, 2015?

A    Despite the challenging environment, the Trust managed to produce modestly
     positive results over the 12-month period. The primary factors aiding the
     Trust's performance relative to the Barclays Index were the tilt towards
     higher-quality loans, compared with the benchmark, in the Trust's portfolio
     and our concerted effort to de-emphasize investments in sectors that
     struggled during the period, such as loans to companies in the energy,
     utilities, and metals and mining groups. For example, at the end of the
     12-month period, on November 30, 2015, only 2.30% of the Trust's total
     investment portfolio was allocated to energy loans (compared to a benchmark
     weighting of 3.81%), as energy was the worst-performing sector in the loan
     market.

     Conversely, benchmark-relative returns were negatively affected, somewhat,
     by the Trust's very small exposure to common stocks as well as by
     individual security selection results among some of the Trust's holdings in
     the aforementioned energy and metals and mining sectors.

     With regard to individual investments, loans to three companies in health
     care-related fields - Virtual Radiological, Rural/Metro, and Accelent -
     performed very well for the Trust during the period after each firm was
     acquired by a competitor, thus allowing their debt to be retired. Virtual
     Radiological is a diagnostic imaging service provider, Rural/Metro provides
     ambulance services, and Accelent is a medical device supply company.

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 5
<PAGE>

     On the negative side, although the relatively low exposures to energy and
     metals and mining company loans in the Trust's portfolio helped relative
     performance, several holdings from those two groups fared very poorly and
     hurt benchmark-relative returns. Among the underperforming holdings in the
     Trust's portfolio were loans to energy exploration-and-production companies
     Templar Energy and Jonah Energy, and metals companies Essar Steel and
     Noranda Aluminum.

Q    How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the 12-month period
     ended November 30, 2015?

A    At the end of the 12-month period on November 30, 2015, 33.1% of the
     Trust's total managed assets were financed by leverage obtained through a
     revolving credit facility, compared with 32.9% of the Trust's total managed
     assets financed by leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2014.

     Twice during the 12-month period, we reduced the amount of leverage, or
     funds borrowed through the revolving credit facility, in the Trust's
     portfolio. Despite these reductions, the percentage of financed leverage
     increased due to a decrease in the values of securities in which the Trust
     had invested. The decrease in the values of the securities was primarily a
     result of the average bid price of the Standard & Poor's/Loan Services
     Trading Association Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index) dropping from
     $98.40 at the beginning of the 12-month period, to $94.57 by the end of the
     period.

Q    Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the 12-month
     period ended November 30, 2015, and did those investments have an effect on
     performance?

A    Yes, the Trust had a small exposure to Markit CDX (North American high-
     yield credit default swap index) during the period. The position did not
     have a material effect on the Trust's performance.

Q    What factors affected the Trust's yield during the 12-month period ended
     November 30, 2015?

A    The Trust's monthly dividend** to shareholders remained constant during the
     first five months of the period, following a reduction in the dividend in
     July of 2014. During the last seven months of the year, the Trust was able
     to slightly increase its monthly dividend rate due to an increase in
     earnings. Shareholders should be aware, however, that the Trust's dividend
     could be negatively affected as older, higher-yielding loans are called
     back by issuers and subsequently refinanced by loans with lower yields.

**   Dividends are not guaranteed.

6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    As the Trust's new fiscal year began in December 2015, we were expecting
     that the Fed soon would begin a gradual process of raising short-term
     interest rates and end the virtual zero-interest-rate policy that had been
     in effect for roughly seven years (the Fed did eventually raise short-term
     rates in December). The Fed's change in course comes after the steady
     accumulation of evidence that the domestic economy finally appears to be on
     a trajectory for sustained growth that is likely to continue through 2016,
     as recent economic data has shown consistent new-jobs creation which, in
     turn, has supported consumer spending and led to a seven-year high in new
     housing starts.

     We believe tightening of the Fed`s monetary policy could potentially have a
     favorable impact on the Trust's performance, as higher rates should trigger
     increases in yields paid by floating-rate investments, and they also can
     lead to increased investor demand, which could bid up prices for bank loans
     selling at discounts.

     We think the domestic economy should continue to grow at a moderate pace
     over the coming year, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the range
     of 2.25% to 2.50%. Such an environment should help solidify corporate
     balance sheets and lend support to the prices of bank-loan investments,
     which, in general, have been selling at discounts of late, thus leaving
     room for potential price increases. Although it is anticipated by the
     market that the default rate on loans will rise over the next 12 months -
     primarily due to energy and commodity sector defaults (metals and mining) -
     the rate is still projected to remain below its historical average of
     3.12%. Current loan spreads, or the interest rates over and above LIBOR
     charged to borrowers by banks, reflect an implied default rate of greater
     than 6%, an indication that value is present in today's loan market.

     We believe floating-rate loans represent good investment value, especially
     compared with more traditional income-oriented investment alternatives,
     such as bond funds, which are more vulnerable to price pressures in a
     rising-rate environment.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-38 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt
to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered
speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using derivatives can
increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when the market prices,
interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can increase price
fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of their value at
times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the market price of
illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment of the
Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage creates
significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Any information in this shareholder report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is total assets less total
liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases under
the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

* The Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index measures the performance of
high-yield loans. Since comparisons for the Barclays Index begin in December
2005, the chart assumes an initial investment of $9,959 for the index, which is
equal to the Trust's value at 12/30/2005.

** The CS Leveraged Loan Index (the CS Index) is a representative index of
tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The CS Index began in
January 1992. Comparisons to the Trust for the CS Index begin in 2004. The CS
Index was the Trust's benchmark through March 1, 2011, and was at that time
replaced by the Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays Index).
Because the historical performance of the Barclays Index dates back only to
2005, after the inception of the Trust in 2004, the Trust will continue to
provide "Market Value of $10,000 Investment" comparisons for both the CS Index
and the Barclays Index.

Returns of both indices are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
The indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

+    Return for the CS Leveraged Loan Index covers the 10-year period from
     November 30, 2005, through November 30, 2015. Return for the Barclays U.S.
     High Yield Loans Index covers the maximum period for which that index's
     performance is available (December 30, 2005 through November 30, 2015).

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/15

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income and the
Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the
extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements:

A.   Security Valuation

     The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open, as of the close of regular trading
     on the NYSE.

     Fixed income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
     events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value
     methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or
     instrument. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the
     basis of current market prices for other debt securities, historical
     trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities and/or other
     factors. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and other sources, as
     required. Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be
     valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
     service.

     Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
     Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
     prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
     Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
     information

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 45
<PAGE>

     is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the price information
     is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained from an
     alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price quotes are
     available from either the primary or alternative pricing service, broker
     quotes will be solicited.

     Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
     obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other insurance
     linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized reinsurance and
     industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price obtained from an
     independent pricing service, or through a third party using a pricing
     matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value methods or
     techniques to provide an estimated value of the instrument.

     Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
     last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
     securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities for
     which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean
     between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked prices
     are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid and
     asked prices are provided by independent third party pricing services. In
     the case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are
     typically determined by independent third party pricing services using a
     variety of techniques and methods.

     The principal exchanges and markets for non-U.S. equity securities have
     closing times prior to the close of the NYSE. However, the value of these
     securities may be influenced by changes in global markets occurring after
     the closing times of the local exchanges and markets up to the time the
     Trust determines its net asset value. Consequently, the Trust uses a fair
     value model developed by an independent pricing service to value non-U.S.
     equity securities. On a daily basis, the pricing service recommends
     changes, based on a proprietary model, to the closing market prices of each
     non-U.S. security held by the Trust to reflect the security's fair value at
     the time the Trust determines its net asset value. The Trust applies these
     recommendations in accordance with procedures approved by the Board of
     Trustees.

     Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
     centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
     obtained from reputable International Swap Dealer association members.
     Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
     by the central clearing counterparty.

     Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are valued daily using the
     foreign exchange rate or, for longer term forward contract positions, the
     spot currency rate, in each case provided by a third party pricing service.
     Contracts whose forward settlement date falls between two quoted days are
     valued by interpolation.

46 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

     Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
     mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Repurchase
     agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time deposits at
     approved financial institutions.

     Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services are
     unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are
     not readily available or are considered to be unreliable are valued by a
     fair valuation team comprised of certain personnel of Pioneer Investment
     Management, Inc. (PIM), the Trust's investment adviser, pursuant to
     procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation
     team uses fair value methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the
     Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team is responsible for monitoring
     developments that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and
     assessing fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
     Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

     Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
     include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
     market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
     methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the
     close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to
     the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
     event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
     natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation
     of the Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and
     such differences could be material.

     At November 30, 2015, there were no securities valued using fair value
     methods (other than securities valued using prices supplied by independent
     prices services, broker-dealers or through a third party using an insurance
     industry valuation model).

B.   Investment Income and Transactions

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     date in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Interest income, including
     interest on income bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis,
     net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
     rates.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 47
<PAGE>

     Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted
     or amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective
     yield to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
     cost basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
     mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
     monthly paydowns.

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
     sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
     financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
     represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
     currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
     between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually
     received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
     rates on investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
     the effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are
     included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
     exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
     realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a
     closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may
     arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
     counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
     movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

E.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to
     its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As
     of November 30, 2015, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties
     with respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be
     recorded as an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax
     returns filed within the prior three years remain subject to examination by
     federal and state tax authorities.

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

     The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
     shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
     which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
     temporary overdistributions for financial statement and tax purposes.
     Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent
     book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for
     temporary differences.

     At November 30, 2015, the Trust reclassified $655,153 to decrease
     undistributed net investment income and $655,153 to decrease accumulated
     net realized loss on investments to reflect permanent book/tax differences.
     These adjustments have no impact on the net assets or results of
     operations.

     At November 30, 2015, the Trust was permitted to carryforward $1,535,719 of
     short-term capital losses and $21,402,411 of long-term capital losses
     without limitation. Additionally, at November 30, 2015, the Trust had a net
     capital loss carryforward of $120,602,379 of which the following amounts
     will expire between 2016 and 2019 if not utilized: $27,976,876 in 2016,
     $62,461,978 in 2017, $11,415,660 in 2018, and $18,747,865 in 2019. Since
     unlimited losses are required to be used first, loss carryforwards that are
     subject to expiration may be more likely to expire unused.

     The Trust has elected to defer $1,586,040 of long-term capital losses
     recognized between June 1, 2015 and November 30, 2015 to its fiscal year
     ending November 30, 2016.

     The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the years
     ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014 were as follows:

<PAGE>

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
     gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
     difference between book and tax amortization methods and discounts on fixed
     income securities and book/tax temporary differences.

F.   Insurance Linked Securities (ILS)

     Event-linked bonds are floating rate debt obligations for which the return
     of principal and the payment of interest are contingent on the
     non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an
     earthquake of a specific magnitude. The trigger event's magnitude may be
     based on losses to a company or industry, industry indexes or readings of
     scientific instruments, or may be based on specified actual losses. If a
     trigger event, as defined within the terms of an event-linked bond occurs,
     the Trust may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest and/or
     principal invested in such event-linked bond. The Trust is entitled to
     receive principal and interest payments so long as no trigger event occurs
     of the description and magnitude specified by the instrument. In addition
     to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds may expose the Trust to
     other risks, including but not limited to issuer (credit) default, adverse
     regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

     The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
     ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
     reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share instruments
     (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance
     relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
     collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
     reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs"),
     are subject to the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, because
     quota share instruments represent an interest in a basket of underlying
     reinsurance contracts, the Trust has limited transparency into the
     individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk
     assessment and sound underwriting practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it
     may be more difficult for PIM to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile
     of the Trust's investment in quota share instruments and therefore place
     the Trust's assets at greater risk of loss than if PIM had more complete
     information.

     Quota share instruments and other structured reinsurance instruments
     generally will be considered illiquid securities by the Trust. These
     securities may be difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid
     securities also may be difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell
     an illiquid asset, the Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

G.   Risks

     Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
     Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
     in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
     those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
     Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
     interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
     economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
     those industries and sectors.

     The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
     floating rate loans and event-linked bonds sometimes referred to as
     "catastrophe" bonds or "insurance-linked" bonds. The Trust may invest in
     securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
     that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined by
     the investment adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment
     grade securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
     considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay
     interest and repay principal. Below investment grade securities, including
     floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater
     price volatility, and are less liquid and more difficult to value,
     especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher
     rated debt securities. The trust may invest in securities of issuers that
     are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if any,
     securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet
     the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to liquidate. No active
     trading market may exist for many floating rate loans, and many loans are
     subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market may be subject to
     irregular trading activity and extended settlement periods. The Trust's
     investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited developing
     markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
     developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
     conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
     currency exchange restrictions.

H.   Repurchase Agreements

     Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
     securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
     the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
     Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
     than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
     as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
     repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
     interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
     The collateral for all repurchase agreements is

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 51
<PAGE>

     held in safekeeping in the customer-only account of the Trust's custodian
     or a subcustodian of the Trust. The Trust's investment adviser, PIM is
     responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
     least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of a default by the
     counterparty, the Trust is entitled to sell the securities, but the Trust
     may not be able to sell them for the price at which they were purchased,
     thus causing a loss to the Trust. Additionally, if the counterparty becomes
     insolvent, there is some risk that the Trust will not have a right to the
     securities, or the immediate right to sell the securities.

I.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
     automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
     Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
     distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
     the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
     Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
     capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
     voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
     notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
     shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
     any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
     effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
     distribution.

     If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
     other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
     the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
     the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A
     firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in shares of the
     Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
     the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
     authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
     on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
     any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
     market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
     premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
     shares. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each account
     will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net
     asset value per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the
     maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the date
     of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend,
     the net asset value per share is greater

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

     than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no
     brokerage charges with respect to newly issued shares. However, each
     participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
     with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in
     the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local
     taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners
     holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may be able to transfer the
     shares to another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

J.   Credit Default Swap Agreements

     A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
     seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event. The Trust may sell
     or buy credit default swap contracts to seek to increase the Trust's
     income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of default on portfolio securities.
     A credit default swap index is used to hedge risk or take a position on a
     basket of credit entities or indices. As a seller of protection, the Trust
     would be required to pay the notional (or other agreed-upon) value of the
     referenced debt obligation to the counterparty in the event of a default by
     a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely
     result in a loss to the Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the
     counterparty a periodic stream of payments during the term of the contract
     provided that no event of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to
     the seller would be the notional value of the credit default swaps
     outstanding. If no default occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of
     payments and would have no payment obligation. The Trust may also buy
     credit default swap contracts in order to hedge against the risk of default
     of debt securities, in which case the Trust would function as the
     counterparty referenced above.

     When the Trust enters into a credit default swap contract, the protection
     buyer makes an upfront or periodic payment to the protection seller in
     exchange for the right to receive a contingent payment. An upfront payment
     made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset in the
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by
     the Trust are recorded as realized gains or losses in the Statement of
     Operations.

     Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
     supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
     recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of
     Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a credit
     event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of the
     appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses in
     the Statement of Operations.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 53
<PAGE>

     Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
     greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
     instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
     market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
     Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
     investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
     the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust, together
     with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount the Trust
     pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.

     Open credit default swap contracts at November 30, 2015 are listed at the
     end of Schedule of Investments.

     The average market value of swap contracts open during the year ended
     November 30, 2015 was $25,296.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not
include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the year ended November 30, 2015, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.04% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At November 30,
2015, $365,866 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative
costs and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agents

Prior to November 2, 2015, Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services,
Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a
sub-transfer agency agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
(AST), provided substantially all transfer agent and shareowner services related
to the Trust's shares at negotiated rates.

Effective November 2, 2015, AST serves as the transfer agent with respect to the
Trust's common shares. The Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to from
time to time by the Trust and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Trust's custodian expenses. For the year ended November 30, 2015, the Trust
expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.

5. Unfunded and Bridge Loan Commitments

Bridge loans are designed to provide temporary or "bridge" financing to a
borrower pending the sale of identified assets or the arrangement of longer term
loans or the issuance and sale of debt obligations.

As of November 30, 2015, the Trust had one bridge loan commitment of $362,319,
which could be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to the following

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust, as of November 30,
2015, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then
ended and the statements of changes in net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights for the years
ended November 30, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were audited by other auditors. Those
auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial highlights in their report dated January 24, 2014.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Trust
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of November 30, 2015, by correspondence with the
custodian, brokers and agent banks; where replies were not received from brokers
and agent banks, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust as of November 30, 2015, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for each of the two years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (unaudited)

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its shares
in the open market.

PIM, the Trust's investment adviser, is currently an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of UniCredit. On November 11, 2015, UniCredit announced that it
signed a binding master agreement with Banco Santander and affiliates of Warburg
Pincus and General Atlantic (the "Private Equity Firms") with respect to Pioneer
Investments ("Pioneer") and Santander Asset Management ("SAM") (the
"Transaction").

The Transaction, as previously announced by UniCredit, will establish a holding
company, with the name Pioneer Investments, to be owned by UniCredit (50%) and
the Private Equity Firms (50% between them). The holding company will control
Pioneer's U.S. operations, including PIM. The holding company also will own
66.7% of Pioneer's and SAM's combined operations outside the U.S., while Banco
Santander will own directly the remaining 33.3% stake. The closing of the
Transaction is expected to happen in 2016, subject to certain regulatory and
other approvals.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, completion of the Transaction will
cause the Trust's current investment advisory agreement with PIM to terminate.
Accordingly, the Trust's Board of Trustees will be asked to approve a new
investment advisory agreement. If approved by the Board, the Trust's new
investment advisory agreement will be submitted to the shareholders of the Trust
for their approval.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) serves as the investment adviser to
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between PIM and the Trust. In order for PIM to remain the investment
adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine annually whether
to renew the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in January 2015 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the process.
Contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in March 2015 and July
2015. Supplemental contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in
September 2015. In addition, the Trustees reviewed and discussed the Trust's
performance at regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year and took into
account other information related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at
regularly scheduled meetings in connection with the review of the Trust's
investment advisory agreement.

In March 2015, the Trustees, among other things, discussed the memorandum
provided by Trust counsel that summarized the legal standards and other
considerations that are relevant to the Trustees in their deliberations
regarding the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, and reviewed and
discussed the qualifications of the investment management teams, as well as the
level of investment by the Trust's portfolio manager in the Trust. In July 2015,
the Trustees, among other things, reviewed the Trust's management fee and total
expense ratios, the financial statements of PIM and its parent companies, the
profitability analyses provided by PIM, and possible economies of scale. The
Trustees also reviewed the profitability of the institutional business of PIM
and PIM's affiliate, Pioneer Institutional Asset Management, Inc. (together with
PIM, "Pioneer"), as compared to that of PIM's fund management business, and
considered the differences between the fees and expenses of the Trust and the
fees and expenses of Pioneer's institutional accounts, as well as the different
services provided by PIM to the Trust and by Pioneer to the institutional
accounts. The Trustees further considered contract review materials in September
2015.

At a meeting held on September 15, 2015, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the Independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for another year. In approving the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees considered various
factors that they determined were relevant, including the factors described
below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the controlling factor
in determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

62 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by PIM to the Trust, taking into account the investment objective
and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees also reviewed PIM's investment approach
for the Trust and its research process. The Trustees considered the resources of
PIM and the personnel of PIM who provide investment management services to the
Trust. They also reviewed the amount of non-Trust assets managed by the
portfolio manager of the Trust. The Trustees considered the non-investment
resources and personnel of PIM involved in PIM's services to the Trust,
including PIM's compliance and legal resources and personnel. The Trustees noted
the substantial attention and high priority given by PIM's senior management to
the Pioneer fund complex.

The Trustees considered that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including Trust
officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by PIM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement.

Performance of the Trust

In considering the Trust's performance, the Trustees regularly review and
discuss throughout the year data prepared by PIM and information comparing the
Trust's performance with the performance of its peer group of funds as
classified by each of Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar) and Lipper, and with the
performance of the Trust's benchmark index. They also discuss the Trust's
performance with PIM on a regular basis. The Trustees' regular reviews and
discussions were factored into the Trustees' deliberations concerning the
renewal of the advisory agreement.

Management Fee and Expenses

The Trustees considered information showing the fees and expenses of the Trust
in comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the Independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party. In all
quintile rankings referred to below, first quintile is most favorable to the
Trust's shareowners.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15 63
<PAGE>

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee (based on managed
assets) for the most recent fiscal year was in the first quintile relative to
the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for
the comparable period. The Trustees considered that the expense ratio (based on
managed assets) of the Trust's common shares for the most recent fiscal year was
in the first quintile relative its Strategic Insight peer group, in each case
for the comparable period.

The Trustees reviewed management fees charged by Pioneer to institutional and
other clients, including publicly offered European funds sponsored by affiliates
of Pioneer, unaffiliated U.S. registered investment companies (in a sub-advisory
capacity), and unaffiliated foreign and domestic separate accounts. The Trustees
also considered PIM's costs in providing services to the Trust and Pioneer's
costs in providing services to the other clients and considered the differences
in management fees and profit margins for Trust and non-Trust services. In
evaluating the fees associated with Pioneer's client accounts, the Trustees took
into account the respective demands, resources and complexity associated with
the Trust and client accounts. The Trustees noted that, in some instances, the
fee rates for those clients were lower than the management fee for the Trust and
considered that, under the investment advisory agreement with the Trust, PIM
performs additional services for the Trust that it does not provide to those
other clients or services that are broader in scope, including oversight of the
Trust's other service providers and activities related to compliance and the
extensive regulatory and tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The Trustees
also considered the different entrepreneurial risks associated with PIM's
management of the Trust and Pioneer's management of the other client accounts.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to PIM was
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided by PIM
to the Trust.

Profitability

The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses.
The Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in
comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that the
profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors,

64 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/15
<PAGE>

including its organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The
Trustees concluded that PIM's profitability with respect to the management of
the Trust was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale

The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is a
closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees concluded
that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the renewal of the
investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits

The Trustees considered the other benefits to PIM from its relationship with the
Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services provided
by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and
profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business. Pioneer is the
principal U.S. asset management business of Pioneer Global Asset Management, the
worldwide asset management business of UniCredit Group, which manages over $150
billion in assets (including the Funds). Pioneer and the Funds receive
reciprocal intangible benefits from the relationship, including mutual brand
recognition and, for the Funds, direct and indirect access to the resources of a
large global asset manager. The Trustees concluded that any such benefits
received by Pioneer as a result of its relationship with the Funds were
reasonable and their consideration of the advisory agreement between the Trust
and PIM and the fees thereunder were unaffected by Pioneer's possible receipt of
any such intangible benefits.

Conclusion

After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors, the
Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered
into on or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the
new SEC pre-approval rules, the Trust's audit
committee is required to pre-approve services to
affiliates defined by SEC rules to the extent that the
services are determined to have a direct impact on the
operations or financial reporting of the Trust.  For the
years ended November 30 2015 and 2014, there were no
services provided to an affiliate that required the
Trust's audit committee pre-approval.


(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountants engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrants accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrants

adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust were $9,876
payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP for the year ended
November 30, 2015 and $9,876 for the year ended November 30, 2014.

(h) Disclose whether the registrants audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrants investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit
services that were rendered to the Affiliates (as
defined) that were not pre- approved pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrant's audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

N/A

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

N/A

Included in Item 1


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual report on
this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the
company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

                                       16



ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company that
is filing an annual report on this Form N-CSR,provide the following
information:
(1) State the name, title, and length of service of the person or persons
employed by or associated with the registrant or an investment adviser
of the registrant who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
When a portfolio manager is responsible for the management of more than one
account, the potential arises for the portfolio manager to favor one account
over another. The principal types of potential conflicts of interest that may
arise are discussed below. For the reasons outlined below, Pioneer does not
believe that any material conflicts are likely to arise out of a portfolio
manager's responsibility for the management of the fund as well as one or more
other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted procedures that it believes are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal securities
laws and to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest to affect its
portfolio management decisions, there can be no assurance that all conflicts
will be identified or that all procedures will be effective in mitigating the
potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of such conflicts of interest
are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager has a financial incentive
to favor one account over another. Pioneer has structured its compensation
arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit such potential for conflicts
of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio Managers" below.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating new
  investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial public
  offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial public
  offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly shortly
  after the offering was allocated to a single account, that account may be
  expected to have better investment performance than other accounts that did
  not receive an allocation of the initial public offering. Generally,
  investments for which there is limited availability are allocated based upon
  a range of factors including available cash and consistency with the
  accounts' investment objectives and policies. This allocation methodology
  necessarily involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
  opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata


                                       0
<PAGE>

 basis. Although Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably designed to
 treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there may be instances
 where a fund may not participate, or may participate to a lesser degree than
 other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
  which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager determines
  to purchase a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that
  may influence the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or
  sold the security first may receive a more favorable price than accounts
  that made subsequent transactions. The less liquid the market for the
  security or the greater the percentage that the proposed aggregate purchases
  or sales represent of average daily trading volume, the greater the
  potential for accounts that make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a
  less favorable price. When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same
  security on the same day for more than one account, the trades typically are
  "bunched," which means that the trades for the individual accounts are
  aggregated and each account receives the same price. There are some types of
  accounts as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons
  (such as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise
  where the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
  best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as favorable
  a price as possible for such client.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
  compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater degree
  than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for example, the
  portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the performance of certain
  accounts relative to a benchmark while other accounts are disregarded for
  this purpose, the portfolio manager will have a financial incentive to seek
  to have the accounts that determine the portfolio manager's bonus achieve
  the best possible performance to the possible detriment of other accounts.
  Similarly, if Pioneer receives a performance-based advisory fee, the
  portfolio manager may favor that account, whether or not the performance of
  that account directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has a
  beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client or to
  compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the portfolio
  manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was one of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio manager would have
  an economic incentive to favor the account in which the portfolio manager
  held an interest.

o If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
  investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise. For
  example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account and
  sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern may
  disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making portfolio
  manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially conflicting
  situations. However, where a portfolio manager is responsible for accounts
  with differing investment objectives and policies, it is possible that the
  portfolio manager will conclude that it is in the best interest of one
  account to sell a portfolio security while another account continues to hold
  or increase the holding in such security.


COMPENSATION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation for portfolio managers that seeks
to align the financial interests of the portfolio managers with those of
shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer funds) the portfolio managers
manage, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. The compensation
program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes a base salary (determined
by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual bonus program, as well as
customary benefits that are offered generally to all full-time employees. Base
compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an annual basis. Pioneer
seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking into account the
experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The bonus plan is
intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation that is
tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment performance and
align the interests of


                                       1
<PAGE>

the investment professional with those of shareholders, as well as with the
financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus under the plan is completely
discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may be in excess of base
salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the following factors:

o QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The quantitative investment performance
  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of all of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the fund and any
  other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-year period (20%
  weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting), measured for periods ending
  on December 31. The accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a
  group of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and investment
  focus (60%) and a broad-based securities market index measuring the
  performance of the same type of securities in which the accounts invest
  (40%), which, in the case of the fund, is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
  High Yield Master II Index. As a result of these two benchmarks, the
  performance of the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured
  against the criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's
  competitive universe.

o QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE. The qualitative performance component with respect
  to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager includes objectives,
  such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork, leadership, communications
  and marketing, that are mutually established and evaluated by each portfolio
  manager and management.

o PIONEER RESULTS AND BUSINESS LINE RESULTS. Pioneer's financial performance,
  as well as the investment performance of its investment management group,
  affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a leverage factor of plus or
  minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers participate in other programs designed to reward and
retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees are granted
performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and the
financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT
INVESTMENT COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781).

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of
Regulation S-R(17 CFR 229.407)(as required by Item 22(b)(15))
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-R of Schedule 14(A)
in its definitive proxy statement, or this item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive and
principal financials officers, or persons performing similar functions,
regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report
that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph,
based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule
30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30(a)-3(b) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on the evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose any change in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act (17CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that
occured during the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)) , exactly as set forth below:

Filed herewith.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

<PAGE>

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
