     at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total
     return for a period of less than one year is not annualized.

+++  Effective in 2008, a change in accounting policy was adopted with regard to
     the calculation of the portfolio turnover rate. Had this policy been
     adopted retroactively, the portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal years
     ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004 would have been 58.0%, 30.8%,
     39.5%, and 48.7%, respectively. The portfolio turnover rate for the period
     ended December 31, 2003 would have been as shown.

*    Based on net asset value per share at commencement of operations of $19.06
     per share.

**   Based on market value per share at initial public offering of $20.00 per
     share.

***  Based on fiscal year to date book income. Amounts are subject to change and
     recharacterization at fiscal year end.

(a)  Calculated based upon average common shares outstanding on the record dates
     throughout the period.

(b)  Based on weekly prices.

(c)  Asset coverage is calculated by combining all series of preferred shares.

(d)  Amount represents less than $0.005 per share.

(e)  Annualized.

(f)  The ratios do not include a reduction of expenses for custodian fee credits
     on cash balances maintained with the custodian. Including such custodian
     fee credits for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the ratios of
     operating expenses to average net assets attributable to common shares net
     of fee reduction would have been 1.37% and the ratios of operating expenses
     to average net assets including liquidation value of preferred shares net
     of fee reduction would have been 1.10%. For the six months ended June 30,
     2008 and fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the effect of the
     custodian fee credits was minimal.

(g)  The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust commenced investment operations on
     November 28, 2003.

(h)  The beginning NAV includes a $0.04 reduction for costs associated with the
     initial public offering.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (the "Fund") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on November 18, 2003 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Investment operations commenced on
November 28, 2003.

     The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends and income. The Fund will attempt to
achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal market conditions,
at least 80% of its assets in dividend paying securities (such as common and
preferred stock) or other income producing securities (such as fixed income debt
securities and securities that are convertible into equity securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION. Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's official closing price as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, the security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the relevant
market, but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Board
if market conditions change significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued.
Debt instruments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board determines such
amount does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these
securities will be fair valued as determined by the Board. Debt instruments
having a maturity greater than 60 days for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is valued using the
closing bid price. Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board. Fair valuation methodologies and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial information about the company; comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     On January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157") that clarifies the
definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair
value measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157
are described below:

*    Other financial instruments are derivative instruments not reflected in the
     Schedule of Investments, such as futures, forwards, and swaps which are
     valued at the unrealized appreciation/depreciation on the investment.

     In March 2008, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (The "FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 161, "Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 161") that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 is intended to
improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced
disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses
derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments
affect an entity's results of operations and financial position. Management is
currently evaluating the implications of SFAS 161 on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary government securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System, or with other brokers or
dealers that meet credit guidelines established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the Fund to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest, will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount invested by the Fund in each agreement. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian. To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At June 30,
2008, there were no open repurchase agreements.

     OPTIONS. The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or indices. As a writer of put options, the Fund receives a premium at the
outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the
financial instrument underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the underlying financial instrument decreases between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain, to the extent of the premium, if the price of the financial
instrument increases between those dates. If a call option is exercised, the
premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security in
determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put option is
exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security.


                                       16

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     As a purchaser of put options, the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put option the underlying security at a specified
price. The seller of the put has the obligation to purchase the underlying
security upon exercise at the exercise price. If the price of the underlying
security declines, the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise. If the
price of the underlying security increases or stays the same, the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at the expiration date, but only to the extent of
the premium paid.

     In the case of call options, these exercise prices are referred to as
"in-the-money," "at-the-money," and "out-of-the-money," respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying security will remain stable or decline during the option
period, (b) covered at-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the
price of the underlying security will remain stable, decline or advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the underlying security above
the exercise price of the option. Out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and
in-the-money put options (the reverse of call options as to the relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions. At June 30, 2008,
the Fund had no investments in options.

     SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into equity, contract for difference,
and interest rate swap or cap transactions. The use of swaps and caps is a
highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio transactions. Swap
agreements may involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and counterparty
risk, and exposure to loss in excess of the related amounts reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In an interest rate swap, the Fund would
agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap (which is known as the
"counterparty") periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the
counterparty agreeing to pay to the Fund periodically a variable rate payment
that is intended to approximate the Fund's variable rate payment obligation on
Series B Preferred Shares. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium
to the counterparty and, to the extent that a specified variable rate index
exceeds a predetermined fixed rate, would receive from that counterparty
payments of the difference based on the notional amount of such cap. In a swap,
a set of future cash flows are exchanged between two counterparties. One of
these cash flow streams will typically be based on a reference interest rate
combined with the performance of a notional value of shares of a stock. The
other will be based on the performance of the shares of a stock. Swap and cap
transactions introduce additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay preferred share dividends when due in accordance with the Statement of
Preferences even if the counterparty defaulted. If there is a default by the
counterparty to a swap contract, the Fund will be limited to contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. There is no
assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be able to meet their
obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event of default, the
Fund will succeed in pursuing contractual remedies. The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining payments owed to it
pursuant to a swap contract. The creditworthiness of the swap contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general state of short-term interest rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio securities at that point in time, such a default could negatively
affect the Fund's ability to make dividend payments. In addition, at the time a
swap or a cap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a
risk that the Fund will not be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that
the terms of the replacement will not be as favorable as on the expiring
transaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the Fund's
ability to make dividend payments.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market and counterparty risk in excess of the amount recognized below.

     Unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The change in value of swaps, including the accrual of periodic amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as unrealized gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Fund receives a variable rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2008 are as follows:

</TABLE>

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the
value of securities it intends to purchase. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the
value of the contract, which are included in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and futures contracts. The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging instrument. The change in value of futures contracts primarily
corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market. At June 30, 2008, there were no open
futures contracts.

     SECURITIES SOLD SHORT. The Fund may enter into short sale transactions.
Short selling involves selling securities that may or may not be owned and, at
times, borrowing the same securities for delivery to the purchaser, with an
obligation to replace such borrowed securities at a later date. The proceeds
received from short sales are recorded as liabilities and the Fund records an
unrealized gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds
received and the value of an open short position on the day of determination.
The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short position is closed out.
By entering into a short sale, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable
change in the price of the security sold short. Dividends on short sales are
recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend date and interest expense
is recorded on the accrual basis. At June 30, 2008, there were no open
securities sold short.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the transaction is denominated or another currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward rate and are marked-to-market daily. The change in market value is
included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign
currency translations. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The use of forward foreign exchange contracts does not eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future. Although
forward foreign exchange contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their contracts. At June 30, 2008, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income, and expenses are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities have been included
in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency
translations. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions, foreign
currency transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and
dividends recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually received.
The portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers. Investing in securities of foreign issuers involves special risks not
typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The risks
include possible revaluation of currencies, the ability to repatriate funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political and economic developments. Moreover, securities of many foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable, based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. The Fund is not subject to an
independent limitation on the amount it may invest in securities for which the
markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities include securities the disposition of
which is subject to substantial legal or contractual restrictions. The sale of
illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage
charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of
securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the
over-the-counter markets. Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than
similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale. Securities
freely saleable among qualified institutional investors under special rules
adopted by the SEC may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity standards
established by the Board. The continued liquidity of such securities is not as
well assured as that of publicly traded securities, and accordingly the Board
will monitor their liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted for on the trade date with realized gain or loss on investments
determined by using the identified cost method. Interest income (including
amortization of premium and accretion of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized using the
effective yield to maturity method. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date except for certain dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS AND INTEREST EXPENSE. When cash balances are
maintained in the custody account, the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits." When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee of 2.00% above the federal funds
rate on outstanding balances. This amount, if any, would be shown as "interest
expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to common shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders are based on
income and capital gains as determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency transactions held by the Fund, timing differences, and
differing characterizations of distributions made by the Fund. Distributions
from net investment income include net realized gains on foreign currency
transactions. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications have no impact on the NAV of the Fund.

     Distributions to shareholders of the Fund's 5.875% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series C
Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares, 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Shares, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares ("Cumulative
Preferred Shares") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described
in Note 5.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007 was as follows:

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its net investment company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

     FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (the "Interpretation") established a
minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of
positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether the Fund is taxable in
a particular jurisdiction) and required certain expanded tax disclosures.

     For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not have any liability
for any unrecognized tax benefits. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties,
if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expenses in the
Statement of Operations. The Fund is not subject to examination by U.S. federal
tax authorities for tax years before 2004 and by state tax authorities for tax
years before 2003.

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee, computed weekly and paid
monthly, equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average
weekly net assets including the liquidation value of preferred shares. In
accordance with the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides a continuous
investment program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the management fee on the incremental assets attributable to the Preferred
Shares if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction, does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Preferred Shares for the fiscal year.

     The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular
series of Preferred Shares for the period. For the six months ended June 30,
2008, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares did not exceed the
stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate on any of the outstanding
Preferred Shares. Thus, management fees with respect to the liquidation value of
the preferred share assets were reduced by $2,486,339.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid brokerage
commissions on security trades of $385,467 to Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli
& Company"), an affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser. During the six
months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid or accrued $22,500 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Fund compensates officers of the
Fund, who are employed by the Fund and are not employed by the Adviser (although
the officers may receive incentive based variable compensation from affiliates
of the Adviser) and pays its allocated portion of the cost of the Fund's Chief
Compliance Officer. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid or
accrued $140,873, which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

</TABLE>

     The Fund's Declaration of Trust, as amended, authorizes the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative Preferred Shares. The
Cumulative Preferred Shares is senior to the common shares and results in the
financial leveraging of the common shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common shareholders. Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Shares are cumulative. The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Statements of Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect to the Cumulative Preferred Shares. If the Fund fails to meet these
requirements and does not correct such failure, the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the 5.875% Series A, Series B Auction Market, Series
C Auction Market, 6.00% Series D, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Shares at redemption prices of $25, $25,000, $25,000, $25, and $25,000,
respectively, per share plus an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid
dividends whether or not declared on such shares in order to meet these
requirements. Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset coverage
requirements could restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common
shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities at inopportune
times. The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner unrelated
to the fixed and variable rates, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to common
shareholders.

     At the Fund's August 15, 2007 Board meeting, the Board approved the filing
of a shelf registration with the SEC which will give the Fund the ability to
offer additional preferred shares. The shelf registration was declared effective
by the SEC on June 17, 2008.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $77,280,971 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,520,000 and offering expenses of $199,029) from the
public offering of 3,200,000 shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred
Shares. Commencing October 12, 2009 and thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares in whole or in part at
the redemption price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of
Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares in the open market at prices less than the
$25 liquidation value per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the
Fund did not repurchase any shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred
Shares. At June 30, 2008, 3,200,000 shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative
Preferred Shares were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $65,278.

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $217,488,958 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,200,000 and offering expenses of $311,042) from the
public offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative Preferred Shares, respectively. The dividend rate, as set by
the auction process, which is generally held every seven days, is expected to
vary with short-term interest rates. If the number of Series B or Series C
Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares subject to bid orders by potential
holders is less than the number of Series B or Series C Auction Market
Cumulative Preferred Shares subject to sell orders, then the auction is
considered to be a failed auction, and the dividend rate will be the maximum
rate. In that event, holders that have submitted sell orders may not be able to
sell any or all of the Series B or Series C Auction Market Cumulative Preferred
Shares for which they have submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate for
both Series B and Series C Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares is 125
basis points greater than the seven day Telerate/British Bankers Association
LIBOR on the day of such auction. The dividend rates of Series B Auction Market
Cumulative Preferred Shares ranged from 3.880% to 5.250% during the six months
ended June 30, 2008. The dividend rates of Series C Auction Market Cumulative
Preferred Shares ranged from 2.296% to 4.498% during the six months ended June
30, 2008. Existing shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such
shares on each auction date. Series B and C Auction Market Cumulative Preferred
Shares shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary market. The Fund, at
its option, may redeem the Series B and C Auction Market Cumulative Preferred
Shares in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the six
months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series B and C
Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares. At June 30, 2008, 4,000 and 4,800
shares of the Series B and C Auction Market Cumulative Preferred Shares were
outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of 3.941% and 3.953% per share and
accrued dividends amounted to $65,683 and $52,706, respectively.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $62,617,239 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,047,500 and offering expenses of $335,261) from the
public offering of 2,600,000 shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Shares. Commencing November 3, 2010 and thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Shares in whole or in part at the
redemption price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series
D Cumulative Preferred Shares in the open market at prices less than the $25
liquidation value per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund
did not repurchase any shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Shares. At
June 30, 2008, 2,600,000 shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Shares
were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $54,167.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $133,379,387 (after
underwriting discounts of $1,350,000 and offering expenses of $270,613) from the
public offering of 5,400 shares of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Shares. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally
held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term interest rates. If
the number of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares subject to bid
orders by potential holders is less than the number of Series E Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Shares subject to sell orders, then the auction is
considered to be a failed auction, and the dividend rate will be the maximum
rate. In that event,

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

holders that have submitted sell orders may not be able to sell any or all of
the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares for which they have
submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is 150 basis points greater than
the seven day Telerate/British Bankers Association LIBOR on the day of such
auction. The dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares
ranged from 3.454% to 5.960% during the six months ended June 30, 2008. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each
auction date. Series E Auction Rate Preferred Shares shareholders may also trade
shares in the secondary market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series E
Auction Rate Preferred Shares in whole or in part at the redemption price at any
time. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not redeem any
shares of Series E Auction Rate Preferred Shares. At June 30, 2008, 5,400 shares
of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares were outstanding with an
annualized dividend rate of 4.180% and accrued dividends amounted to $78,375.

     The holders of Cumulative Preferred Shares generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single class. The
holders of Cumulative Preferred Shares voting together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Trustees and under certain circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the Preferred Shares, voting as a single class, will
be required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the
Preferred Shares, and the approval of two-thirds of each class, voting
separately, of the Fund's outstanding voting stock must approve the conversion
of the Fund from a closed-end to an open-end investment company. The approval of
a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding Preferred Shares and
a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's outstanding voting
securities are required to approve certain other actions, including changes in
the Fund's investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6. TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES OF AFFILIATED ISSUERS. The 1940 Act defines
affiliated issuers as those in which the Fund's holdings of an issuer represent
5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer. A summary of the
Fund's transactions in the securities of this issuer during the six months ended
June 30, 2008 is set forth below:

</TABLE>

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS. The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. OTHER MATTERS. On April 24, 2008, the Adviser entered into an administrative
settlement with the SEC to resolve the SEC's inquiry regarding prior frequent
trading activity in shares of the GAMCO Global Growth Fund (the "Global Growth
Fund") by one investor who was banned from the Global Growth Fund in August
2002. In the settlement, the SEC found that the Adviser had violated Section
206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule
17d-1 thereunder, and had aided and abetted and caused violations of Section
12(d)(1)(B)(i) of the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the settlement, the Adviser,
while neither admitting nor denying the SEC's findings and allegations, agreed,
among other things, to pay the previously reserved total of $16 million
(including a $5 million penalty), of which at least $11 million will be
distributed to shareholders of the Global Growth Fund in accordance with a plan
to be developed by an independent distribution consultant and approved by the
independent directors of the Global Growth Fund and the staff of the SEC, and to
cease and desist from future violations of the above referenced federal
securities laws. The settlement will

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

not have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its ability to fulfill its
obligations under the Advisory Agreement. On the same day, the SEC filed a civil
action against the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Adviser, alleging violations of certain federal securities laws arising from the
same matter. The officer is also an officer of the Global Growth Fund and other
funds in the Gabelli/GAMCO fund complex. The officer denies the allegations and
is continuing in his positions with the Adviser and the funds. The Adviser
currently expects that any resolution of the action against the officer will not
have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its ability to fulfill its
obligations under the Advisory Agreement.

     On a separate matter, in August 2008, the Adviser made an offer to the
staff of the SEC to settle a previously disclosed matter concerning compliance
with Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 of the 1940 Act by two closed-end funds
managed by the Adviser. These provisions require registered investment companies
to provide written statements to shareholders when a distribution is made in the
nature of a dividend from a source other than net investment income. While the
two funds sent annual statements and provided other materials containing this
information, the funds did not send the notices required by Rule 19a-1 to
shareholders with each distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that
the funds have been in compliance with Rule 19a-1 since that time. The Adviser
believes that the settlement would have no effect on the funds or any material
adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the funds. This offer of
settlement is subject to final agreement regarding the specific language of the
SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents and approval by the
SEC.

                        AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                       AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

     It is the policy of The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (the "Fund") to
automatically reinvest dividends payable to common shareholders. As a
"registered" shareholder you automatically become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to credit common shares to participants upon an income dividend or a capital
gains distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading at a discount or
a premium to net asset value. All distributions to shareholders whose shares are
registered in their own names will be automatically reinvested pursuant to the
Plan in additional shares of the Fund. Plan participants may send their common
shares certificates to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") to be
held in their dividend reinvestment account. Registered shareholders wishing to
receive their distributions in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                      The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
                               c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                           Providence, RI 02940-3010

     Shareholders requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and address as they appear on the share certificate. Shareholders with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

     If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank, or nominee, you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan, your account will be credited with a cash dividend. In order to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and re-registered in your own name.
Once registered in your own name your distributions will be automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested. Shareholders wishing a cash dividend at such institution must
contact their broker to make this change.

     The number of shares of common shares distributed to participants in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the
Plan, whenever the market price of the Fund's common shares is equal to or
exceeds net asset value at the time shares are valued for purposes of
determining the number of shares equivalent to the cash dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of common shares valued at
the greater of (i) the net asset value as most recently determined or (ii) 95%
of the then current market price of the Fund's common shares. The valuation date
is the dividend or distribution payment date or, if that date is not a New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset
value of the common shares at the time of valuation exceeds the market price of
the common shares, participants will receive shares from the Fund valued at
market price. If the Fund should declare a dividend or capital gains
distribution payable only in cash, Computershare will buy shares of common
shares in the open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants'
accounts, except that Computershare will endeavor to terminate purchases in the
open market and cause the Fund to issue shares at net asset value if, following
the commencement of such purchases, the market value of the common shares
exceeds the then current net asset value.

     The automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions
will not relieve participants of any income tax which may be payable on such
distributions. A participant in the Plan will be treated for federal income tax
purposes as having received, on a dividend payment date, a dividend or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

     The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another vehicle for our
shareholders to increase their investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan, shareholders must have their shares
registered in their own name.

     Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to Computershare for investments in the Fund's common
shares at the then current market price. Shareholders may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000. Computershare will use these funds to purchase shares in the
open market on or about the 1st and 15th of each month. Computershare will
charge each shareholder who participates $0.75, plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage commissions. Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any voluntary cash payments be sent to Computershare, P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010 such that Computershare receives such payments
approximately 10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month. Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase date. A payment may be withdrawn without charge if notice is
received by Computershare at least 48 hours before such payment is to be
invested.

     SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE must do so
in writing or by telephone. Please submit your request to the above mentioned
address or telephone number. Include in your request your name, address, and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage commission incurred. Brokerage charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

     For more information regarding the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan, brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Fund.

     The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to
any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid
subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by Computershare on at least 90 days written
notice to participants in the Plan.
