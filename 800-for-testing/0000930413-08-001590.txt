             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Managers of
  Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Company"),  including
the schedules of portfolio investments,  securities sold, not yet purchased, and
swap contracts as of December 31, 2007, and the related  statement of operations
for the year then ended,  and the statements of changes in members'  capital for
each of the two years in the period then ended.  These financial  statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting.  Our audits
included  consideration of internal control over financial  reporting as a basis
for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but
not for the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no
such  opinion.  An audit also  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2007, by correspondence with
the  custodian  and other brokers or by other  appropriate  auditing  procedures
where replies from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Advantage  Advisers  Xanthus
Fund,  L.L.C.  at December 31, 2007,  the results of its operations for the year
then ended, and the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended, in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DECEMBER 31, 2007
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of  Managers").  There are
         six  members of the Board of  Managers,  one of whom is  considered  an
         "interested person" under the Act. The Company's  investment adviser is
         Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability
         company (the  "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer
         Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of  Oppenheimer & Co.
         Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
         Company's  investment  activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory
         agreement  dated  June  5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member  of the
         Adviser,   and  Alkeon  Capital  Management  L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a
         non-managing member of the Adviser.  Investment  professionals employed
         by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
         portfolio  manager,  manage the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of the
         Adviser under the supervision of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit
         participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  At a meeting  held on
         November 1, 2004,  the Board of Managers  approved  the  acceptance  of
         initial  contributions  by the  Company  from new  members  on or after
         January 1, 2005.  The Company may from time to time offer to repurchase
         interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such repurchases will
         be made at such  times and on such  terms as may be  determined  by the
         Board of Managers,  in their  complete and  exclusive  discretion.  The
         Adviser  expects  that  generally  it will  recommend  to the  Board of
         Managers that the Company offer to  repurchase  interests  from Members
         twice each year,  effective at the end of the second fiscal quarter and
         again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         A.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i) Domestic  exchange traded  securities (other than options and those

             (2) If no sales of those  securities  are  reported on a particular
                 day, the securities  are valued based upon their  composite bid

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

             (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

             (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the price
                 will be deemed  "stale"  and the value  will be  determined  in
                 accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Disclosures  about  Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         C.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within  three  months at the time of purchase as cash  equivalents.  At
         December  31, 2007,  $45,675,345  in cash  equivalents  was held at PNC
         Bank.

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         The  Company  has  reclassified   ($4,652,106)  and  $294,116,842  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2007.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

         In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
         Interpretation  48 ("FIN 48"),  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income
         Taxes".  This  standard  defines  the  threshold  for  recognizing  the
         benefits  of  tax-return  positions  in  the  financial  statements  as
         "more-likely-than-not"  to be  sustained  by the taxing  authority  and
         requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not
         criterion,  based on the largest  benefit  that is more than 50 percent
         likely to be  realized.  Management  has  analyzed  the  Company's  tax
         positions  taken on federal  income tax  returns for all open tax years
         (tax years ended December 31,  2004-2007) for purposes of  implementing
         FIN 48, and has concluded that a liability of $3,000,000 for income tax
         purposes is required in the Company's financial statements. The Company
         recognizes interest and penalties,  if any, related to unrecognized tax
         benefits within country tax expense in the statement of operations.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

         During the year ended December 31, 2007, Oppenheimer earned $207,855 as
         brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of
         the Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a  broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,  earned  $1,687,783  as brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the year ended
         December 31, 2007, an Incentive  Allocation of $62,592,421 was credited
         to the Special  Advisory  Member's  capital account and was included in
         withdrawals  payable at December 31, 2007,  in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  The
         lead independent manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers
         who are  "interested  persons"  do not  receive any annual or other fee
         from  the  Company.  Managers  who are  not  "interested  persons"  are
         reimbursed  by the Company for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to
         the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
         recordkeeping and investor related  services.  The Company pays PFPC an
         accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the average net
         assets  of the  Company  as of the  last  day of  each  month,  payable
         monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its  discretion.  For the year ended  December 31, 2007,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $240,250.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2007, amounted
         to $2,292,199,368 and $2,364,379,154, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,   for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2007,  amounted  to
         $1,422,182,442 and $1,517,492,390, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2007,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $674,962,863, and $291,428,268, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2007,  accumulated net
         unrealized  appreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet purchased was  $55,382,407,  consisting  of  $97,524,241  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $42,141,834 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet  purchased,  net of excess  cash,  held at the  prime  broker as of
         December 31, 2007.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company incurs the indebtedness. The Company pays interest on out-

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)

         standing margin  borrowings at an annualized rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%.
         The Company pledges securities as collateral for the margin borrowings,
         which are maintained in a segregated account held by the Custodian. For
         the year ended  December  31,  2007,  the average  daily amount of such
         borrowings was $3,947,605  and the daily  weighted  average  annualized
         interest  rate was 4.86%.  The Company had  borrowings  outstanding  at
         December 31, 2007, totaling $6,989,339 recorded as due to broker on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include options,
         swaps  and  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,  these
         financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell
         other  financial  instruments  at specific  terms at  specified  future
         dates. Each of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of
         off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the
         securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets,  liabilities and members' capital. Primarily all investments in
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased and due from broker are positions
         with,  and  amounts  due  from,  the  prime  broker,   Morgan  Stanley.
         Accordingly,  the Fund has a concentration  of individual  counterparty
         credit risk with the prime  broker.  The Fund pledges  securities in an
         account at PFPC Trust Company,  for the benefit of the prime broker, to
         meet the margin requirement as determined by the prime broker.

         A swap is a contract  under  which two parties  agree to make  periodic
         payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index or
         the value of some other instrument,  applied to a stated, or "notional"
         amount.  Swaps  generally  can be  classified  as interest  rate swaps,
         currency swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include
         contracts for difference,  depending on the type of index or instrument
         used to calculate the payments.  Such swaps would  increase or decrease
         the Company's  investment  exposure to the  particular  interest  rate,
         currency,  commodity or equity  involved.  Securities  associated  with
         swaps are marked-to-market  based on the Company's valuation procedures
         that are

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         outlined  in Section 2b of these  notes.  The change in value of swaps,
         including  the  periodic  amounts of interest to be paid or received on
         swaps,  is reported as  unrealized  gains or losses in the Statement of
         Operations.  Net  unrealized  gains  are  reported  as an asset and net
         unrealized  losses are  reported as a  liability  on the  Statement  of
         Assets,  Liabilities and Members'  Capital.  A realized gain or loss is
         recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination
         of swap agreements.

         Most  swap   agreements   entered  into  by  the  Company  require  the
         calculation  of the  obligations  of the parties to the agreements on a
         "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap
         agreement  generally will be equal to only to the net amount to be paid
         or received  under the  agreement  based on the relative  values of the
         positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

         The Company is subject to the market risk  associated  with  changes in
         the  value  of the  underlying  investment  or  instrument,  as well as
         exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on
         swap  contracts.  The risk of loss with  respect to swaps is limited to
         the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually  obligated
         to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the Fund's risk of loss
         consists of the net amount of payments  that the Company  contractually
         is  entitled  to  receive,  which  may be  different  than the  amounts
         recorded on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         The  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather  than the  notional
         amount,  represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
         respectively.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the
         premium  is added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
         security in  determining  whether  the  Company has  realized a gain or
         loss.  In writing an option,  the  Company  bears the market risk of an
         unfavorable change in the price of the security or index underlying the
         written  option.  Exercise of an option  written by the  Company  could
         result in the Company selling or buying a security at a price different
         from the current  market value.  During for the year ended December 31,
         2007, the Company had no transactions in written options.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DECEMBER 31, 2007 (CONCLUDED)

      9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In September  2006,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157, "FAIR VALUE
         MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
         value for  financial  reporting,  establishes a framework for measuring
         fair value and requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair
         value  measurements.  FAS 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements
         issued for fiscal years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim
         periods within those fiscal years. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
         does not  believe  the  adoption  of FAS 157 will  impact  the  amounts
         reported in the financial statements;  however,  additional disclosures
         will be required about the inputs used to develop the  measurements  of
         fair value and the effect of certain of the  measurements  reported  in
         the statement of operations for a fiscal year.

     10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         Subsequent  to December 31, 2007 and through  February  27,  2008,  the
         Company  received  initial and additional  capital  contributions  from
         Members of $27,666,590.

          POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

          Actual or apparent  conflicts  of interest  may arise when a Portfolio
          Manager also has  day-to-day  responsibilities  with respect to one or
          more accounts. These potential conflicts include:

     o    Allocation  of  Limited  Time and  Attention.  Because  the  Portfolio
          Manager manages other accounts,  the Portfolio Manager may not be able
          to  formulate  as complete a strategy or identify  equally  attractive
          investment  opportunities  for  each  of  those  accounts  as  if  the
          Portfolio Manager were to devote  substantially  more attention to the
          management of fewer accounts.

     o    Allocation  of  Investment  Opportunities.  If the  Portfolio  Manager
          identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple
          accounts,  the Fund  may not be able to take  full  advantage  of that
          opportunity because the opportunity may need to be allocated among all
          or many of these accounts.

     o    Pursuit of Differing  Strategies.  At times, the Portfolio Manager may
          determine that an investment  opportunity  may be appropriate for only
          some of the accounts for which he exercises investment responsibility,
          or may decide that  certain of these  accounts  should take  differing
          positions with respect to a particular  security.  In these cases, the
          Portfolio Manager may execute  differing or opposite  transactions for
          one or more accounts which may affect the market price of the security
          or the execution of the transactions, or both, to the detriment of one
          or more of his accounts.

     o    Performance  Fees. The Portfolio  Manager  manages other accounts that
          are subject to a performance  allocation or  performance  fee which in
          some cases may be greater than the fee payable by the Fund. This could
          create a conflict because the Portfolio  Manager may benefit if a more
          attractive  investment is allocated to an account that bears a greater
          performance allocation or fee.

          MEMBERS

          Mr.  Sparaggis'  compensation  consists of periodic  advances  and the
          income from the profits of Alkeon Capital  Management,  LLC derived by
          him as its sole  principal.  The level of Alkeon Capital  Management's
          profitability   in  turn  is  dependent  on  the  advisory   fees  and
          performance  fees and  allocations  received  from the Fund and  other
          advisory clients.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES
        PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.        COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

          This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment
companies set forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund")
applies to each Fund's principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and principal accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set
forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.       COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
          OF INTEREST

          OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or the Covered Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and a Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code. Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts

<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between a Fund
and its investment adviser or a third party service provider of which the
Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the applicable Fund or for its investment adviser or a
third party service provider, or for one or more of them), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationship between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

          Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company.

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     o    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit the Fund; and

     o    report at least annually his or her affiliations or other
          relationships that could potentially present a conflict of interest
          with the Fund.

III.      DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o    each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or
          cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
          within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and
          auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     o    each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within
          the Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
          necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
          other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser
          with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
          understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
          with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
          by the Fund; and

                                       2
<PAGE>

     o    each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
          Fund with applicable standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

IV.       REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the
          Fund that the Covered Officer has received, read and understands the
          Code;

     o    annually thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that
          the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

     o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations of
          the Code that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify the Compliance Officer of the Fund promptly if the Covered
          Officer knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
          itself a violation of this Code.

          The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to
the Fund and counsel to the Managers of the Fund who are not "interested
persons," as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, of the
Fund (the "Independent Managers"), and is encouraged to do so. However, any
approvals or waivers(1) must be considered by the Independent Managers.

          Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o    the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any reported potential violations;

     o    if, after such investigation, the Compliance Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
          any further action;

     o    any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
          reported to the Independent Managers;

     o    if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the
          Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
          which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of,
          and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment

- ---------------
(1)  For this purpose, the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the Fund's
     failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a
     material departure from a provision of the code of ethics that has been
     made known to Fund management.

                                       3
<PAGE>

          adviser or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to
          dismiss the Covered Officer; and

     o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.        OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act of each Fund, its investment adviser and principal
underwriter is a separate requirement applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and is not part of this Code.

VI.       AMENDMENTS

          Amendments to this Code may be made from time to time, as deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance Officer. The Board of each Fund shall be
informed of any such amendment to the extent deemed material by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII.      CONFIDENTIALITY

          All reports and records relating to a Fund prepared or maintained
pursuant to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained
and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code,
such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.

VIII.     INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
