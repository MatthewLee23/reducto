The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust is managed by the Adviser's Senior Loans team,
led by Howard Tiffen, Managing Director of the Adviser.(1)

MARKET OVERVIEW

The semiannual period ended January 31, 2005 saw a continuation of the favorable
backdrop for the senior-loan market that has prevailed for much of the last two
years. The economy maintained a path of healthy growth, inflation remained
modest, and the long-awaited increase in long-term interest rates failed to
materialize. All of these factors continued to support corporate financial
performance, which has been further aided by the strides in efficiency many
companies made over the past several years in response to an increasingly
competitive environment. The significant decline of the U.S. dollar over the
last two-plus years has provided an additional boost to the competitiveness of
many of the companies that underlie the senior loan market, as a weaker dollar
makes foreign goods more expensive to U.S. consumers and U.S. exports of
manufactured goods more competitive. The end result of strong corporate
profitability has been improving credit quality, which has supported the senior-
loan market's performance.

Yield spreads in the senior-loan market began the semiannual period near
historical lows and remained there throughout the period. These narrow spreads
continued to allow a greater range of companies to access the senior-loan market
at very favorable terms. At the same time, an expanding array of institutional
investors has been attracted to the asset class in view of its improved credit
quality, which has been reflected in significantly lower default rates. In fact,
while senior loans have traditionally been considered somewhat speculative,
there is growing appreciation of the asset class' defensive characteristics. As
a result, demand for and inflows into senior loans remained strong, and
investors readily absorbed the healthy supply of new issues that came to market
during the period. In both the primary and secondary markets, demand has
continued to outstrip supply, which has supported the continued narrowing of
spreads.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

A closed-end fund's return can be calculated either upon the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of shares outstanding, while market price
reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two returns can
differ significantly, as they did during the reporting period.

For the six months ended January 31, 2005, the trust returned -0.21 percent on a
market price basis, and 3.05 percent on an NAV basis.

We believe that the trust's performance over the period reflects the resources
we have dedicated to performing fundamental research and analysis on the
companies held in the portfolio. We continue to focus on identifying those
companies that exhibit strong management, solid and predictable cash flows, and
collateral that is sufficient to provide a healthy backstop in the event of
default.

In addition to a strong focus on fundamental company analysis, we continued to
maintain a high level of diversification in the trust's portfolio during the
period in order to minimize the risk of over-concentration in any one sector or
security. We follow a bottom-up security-selection process and generally do not
practice sector rotation. However, we will move to limit the portfolio's
exposure to certain industries facing ongoing challenges. For example, we
continued to minimize the trust's exposure to the auto industry during the
period. We believe that as that industry continues the process of sorting out
the winners from the losers, the risks to auto manufacturers and their suppliers
dictate a cautious approach. We have followed a similar path in
telecommunications, which is experiencing ongoing problems with overcapacity. In
addition, within the healthcare sector, we have avoided exposure to companies
which rely on Medicare reimbursement rates for revenues. Federal budget
constraints put at risk the maintenance of existing reimbursement rates.

The trust also continued to benefit during the period from our use of leverage.
This strategy involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate such as LIBOR and
reinvesting the proceeds at a spread above that rate. We use leverage on an
ongoing basis in an effort to enhance the trust's dividend, as it did during the
reporting period. Unlike with other fixed-income asset classes, using this
strategy in conjunction with a portfolio of senior loans does not involve risk
from rising short-term interest rates, since the income from senior loans
adjusts in tandem with rates that determine our borrowing costs. We are likely
to reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality conditions to prevent
magnifying erosion of the trust's net asset value.
                                                                               3
<PAGE>

Looking ahead, while growth in corporate profits is showing signs of slowing, we
believe profitability and pricing power for the borrowers that underlie the
senior loan market may remain strong. As a result, we expect these companies
will potentially be able to continue to generate free cash-flow and that credit
quality will not deteriorate in any meaningful way. For these reasons, we
believe the environment for senior loans may continue to be quite favorable in
the coming months. We will continue to pursue a disciplined investment approach,
that seeks to balance attractive yields with a relatively stable net asset value
for the trust.

There is no guarantee that any securities will continue to perform well or be
held by the trust in the future.

INVESTMENT POLICY CHANGES

       At a meeting held March 2 and March 3, 2005 the Board of Trustees
       approved a change to the Trust's respective investment policies regarding
       the current investment requirements for senior notes. The changes modify
       the current limitation on senior notes. Such modification allows
       investments in senior notes provided that senior notes represent the only
       form of senior debt financing in the borrower's capital structure or
       enjoy a pair passu position with other senior loans in the borrower's
       capital structure with respect to collateral only and not with respect to
       the other covenants and terms.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(e) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(f) Restricted Security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.27%
    of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

(g) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2005.

(i) All or a portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(j) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(k) Payment-in-kind security.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. The interest
    rates shown are those in effect on January 31, 2005. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

* If certain expenses had not been voluntarily assumed by Van Kampen, total return would have
  been lower and the Ratio of Operating Expenses to Average Net Assets, Ratio of Gross
  Expenses to Average Net Assets and the Ratio of Net Investment Income to Average Net Assets
  would have been 1.21%, 1.49% and 6.90% for the period ended July 31, 1998.

** Non-Annualized
</Table>

(a)Net asset value on June 24, 1998 of $10.00 is adjusted for common share
   offering costs of $.013.

(b)Total return based on common share market price assumes an investment at the
   common share market price at the beginning of the period indicated,
   reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
   Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing
   common share market price at the end of the period indicated.

(c)Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
   variable rate senior loan interests.

(d)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   Borrowings) from the Trust's total assets and dividing by the total number of
   senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
   indebtedness.

(e)As required, effective August 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the year ended July 31, 2002 was to decrease the ratio of net investment
   income to average net asset applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
   investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses
   per share were unaffected by the adjustments. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for the periods prior to July 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(f)Ratios do not reflect the effect of distributions to preferred shareholders.

(g)Ratios reflect the effect of distributions to preferred shareholders.

(h)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of
current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to
achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of interests in
floating or variable rate senior loans to corporations, partnerships and other
entities which operate in a variety of industries and geographical regions. The
Trust borrows money for investment purposes which will create the opportunity
for enhanced return, but also should be considered a speculative technique and
may increase the Trust's volatility. The Trust commenced investment operations
on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED) continued

The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not
less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2004, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $209,217,198, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

                                                                              37

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $1,498,215
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the six months ended January 31, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $52,600 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the Trust
is a partner of such firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as
legal counsel to the Trust.

    Under a Legal Services agreement, the Adviser provides legal services to the
Trust. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to each Trust. For the
six months ended January 31, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $47,700 representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its
affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the
Trust, which are reported as "Legal" expenses in the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable for a ten-year period
and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust. The maximum
annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the costs of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $1,413,699,787 and
$1,352,461,403, respectively.

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Variable Rate Senior Loan agreements,
the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $175,644,025 as of
January 31, 2005. The Trust intends to reserve against such contingent
obligations by segregating cash, liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a
reserve.

5. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

                                                                              39

6. BORROWINGS

As of April 29, 2004, the shareholders approved amending the Trust's fundamental
investment restriction regarding the Trust's use of financial leverage. The
Trust is now able to utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, a fund
generally may not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the fund's total
assets or (ii) issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the fund's total
assets. In using a combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares,
the maximum allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no
event more that 50%) of the Fund's total assets based on the relative amounts
borrowed or preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. For the six months ended January 31, 2005, the average daily balance of
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement was $491,114,130 with a weighted
average interest rate of 1.94%.

7. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

As of February 20, 2004, the Trust issued 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series
T, Series W, Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), $.01 Par
Value, $25,000 liquidation Preference, for a total issuance of $700 million.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on January 31, 2005
was 2.44%. During the six months ended January 31, 2005, the rates ranged from
1.49% to 2.91%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

I, Ronald E. Robison, certify that:

1.    I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Van Kampen Senior Income
      Trust;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
      information included in this report, fairly present in all material
      respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
      assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
      include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d)
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

      a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

      b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

      c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

      d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
          in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
