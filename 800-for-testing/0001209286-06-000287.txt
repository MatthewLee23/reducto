November 15, 2006

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
We are pleased to present you with the semiannual report for Insured Municipal
Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") for the six-month period ended September 30, 2006.

PERFORMANCE
Over the six-month period ended September 30, 2006, the Fund returned 4.33% on a
net asset value basis and 2.10% on a market price basis. Over the same period,
the Fund's peer group, the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged)
category, posted median net asset value and market price returns of 4.05% and
2.52%, respectively. Finally, the Fund's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index (the "Index") returned 3.44% over the semiannual period.
(For more performance information, please refer to "Performance at a glance" on
page 6.)

The Fund continued to use leverage during the period, which helped performance
on an absolute basis. As of September 30, 2006, leverage accounted for
approximately 40% of the Fund's total assets. While short-term rates rose over
the period and increased the Fund's borrowing costs, the leverage still had a
positive effect on the Fund's income during the fiscal year, as the yields on
the Fund's longer-term bonds more than offset the borrowing costs. Leverage
magnifies returns on both the upside and on the downside.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER KEVIN McINTYRE
Q. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?
A. Economic data were generally positive during the past six months, although
   economic growth appears to be slowing from an above-average rate back to
   historical norms. Although the housing market continued to cool, offsetting
   that trend was a sharp decline in energy prices during the final two months
   of the reporting period. Other economic

   indicators were equally mixed; advance GDP data for the third quarter came
   in below expectations, while unemployment remained low and consumer
   confidence high.

Q. HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THESE ECONOMIC
   CONDITIONS?
A. After raising short-term interest rates in 17 consecutive meetings dating
   back to 2004, the Fed left rates unchanged at 5.25% in its past three
   sessions, including its October meeting after the Fund's reporting period
   ended. Future rate hikes remain a possibility, according to Fed releases, as
   "some inflation risks remain." The extent and timing of any future firming,
   or monetary easing for that matter, will likely be dependent on emerging
   economic data.

Q. HOW DID THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET PERFORM IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?
A. The municipal bond market on the whole outperformed Treasuries throughout
   the reporting period. Treasury yields rose, resulting in corresponding price
   declines, while municipal securities with maturities of 10 years and longer
   actually rallied during this same period. The difference in performance
   versus Treasuries was greatest when comparing securities with maturities of
   around 30 years.

Q. IN GENERAL TERMS, HOW DID YOU POSITION THE PORTFOLIO?
A. In terms of duration, our position remained neutral versus the Index during
   this reporting period. (Duration is a measure of a fund's sensitivity to
   interest rate changes and is related to the maturity of the bonds comprising
   the portfolio.) Our position in longer-term maturities benefited the
   portfolio on an absolute basis, as the longer end of the curve outperformed
   every other area on the yield curve. Additionally, some changes to the
   Fund's investment strategies benefited performance. The Fund has increased
   its exposure to lower-quality securities and securities subject to the
   alternative minimum tax (AMT). These changes were implemented to bring the
   Fund's investment style more in line with that of its peers, with the goal
   of making it more competitive. During the course of the period, we used
   these to our advantage. We diversified away from higher grade securities to
   increase the Fund's position in relatively lower-rated securities. We
   likewise increased the Fund's position in AMT securities, to benefit from
   the higher yields associated with these types of bonds.

Q. FROM A SECTOR STANDPOINT, WHAT WERE IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR THE FUND?
A. We strive to maintain a well-diversified portfolio regardless of market
   conditions. As a result, the Fund holds bonds in a number of different

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   sectors. During the reporting period, we have focused our research on
   uncovering new opportunities in the water, airport and hospital sectors.
   This research indicates that the water sector tends to have stronger revenue
   and earnings stability than some other sectors of the municipal market, even
   in changing economic climates. While we reduced the Fund's position in water
   related bonds during the period in order to diversify into other areas, we
   continued to view the sector positively, and it represented the Fund's
   largest sector position at period end.

   Meanwhile, the airport sector continued to rebound during the period. A
   significant portion of airport sector bonds are subject to AMT and tend to
   offer higher yields. The Fund owns NYC IDA revenue bonds for the Terminal
   One Group Association, which have performed well over this period, helping
   us to diversify the credit quality of the portfolio.

   While our long-term outlook for the healthcare sector as a whole remains
   negative, we see positive trends developing for certain healthcare providers
   that have stable or improving finances and strong market share. With that in
   mind, we have selectively added to our holdings in this sector, and
   performance has been solid in recent months.

   Although the tobacco sector posted very strong performance yet again during
   the reporting period, we continued to avoid it, which detracted from
   performance during the period. We do not believe the potential rewards in
   the tobacco sector are commensurate with the risks our analysis indicates
   these bonds entail. In an attempt to concentrate Fund assets on risks we
   feel are likely to be compensated, we minimized our exposure to this sector.

Q. WERE THERE ANY STATES OR REGIONS THAT WERE AN AREA OF FOCUS FOR THE FUND?
A. From a regional standpoint, we continued to focus on states that exhibited
   improved fiscal health and offered what we viewed as attractively valued
   municipal bonds. Issues that we believe met that definition included
   long-term California bonds and New York securities. While we
   opportunistically reduced these positions where we were able to benefit
   performance, they remained our largest single state exposures at period end.
   Additionally, we have increased our exposure to New Jersey bonds, primarily
   with the purchase of New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Bonds, one of our
   best-performing bonds over the period.

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

Q. WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE MUNICIPAL FIXED INCOME MARKET?
A. We are generally more upbeat on the prospects for the economy than some
   market prognosticators. Throughout 2006, corporate earnings have appeared
   quite healthy, while employment and wage data have appeared strong.
   Inflation, high energy prices and the prospect of a bursting housing bubble
   represent the major hurdles facing the economy and the markets, and we find
   it unlikely that any of the three represents enough of a threat to derail
   what has been a period of solid, if not exceptional, economic growth. With
   respect to the municipal bond market, we believe there continue to be
   pockets of attractive valuations along the yield curve and within certain
   sectors. Our in-house research should help position the Fund well in hopes
   of taking advantage of those investment opportunities we identify in the
   months and quarters that follow.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment
objective is to achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from
federal income tax, consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be
no assurance that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

In the normal course of business the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations or that provide indemnifications for certain
liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown,
as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have
not yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant
to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Fund's management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use last reported
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a
good faith determination of a security's fair value. These factors may include,
but are not limited to, the type and cost of the security; contractual or legal
restrictions on resale of the security; relevant financial or business
developments of the issuer; actively traded similar or related

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              27

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

securities; conversion or exchange rights on the security; related corporate
actions; and changes in overall market conditions. If events occur that
materially affect the value of securities (particularly non-US securities)
between the close of trading in those securities and the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the securities are fair valued. The
amortized cost method of valuation, which approximates market value, generally
is used to value short-term debt instruments with sixty days or less remaining
to maturity, unless the Board or its delegate determines that this does not
represent fair value. Securities traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market
are valued at the last bid price available on the valuation date prior to
valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income
is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are
amortized as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of
investments.

FUTURES CONTRACTS--Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is
required to deliver to a broker an amount of cash and/or securities equal to a
certain percentage of the contract amount. This amount is known as the "initial
margin". Subsequent payments, known as "variation margin", are made or received
by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the
underlying financial futures contracts. Such variation margin is recorded for
financial statement purposes on a daily basis as unrealized gain or loss until
the financial futures contract is closed, at which time the net gain or loss is
reclassified to realized gain or loss on futures. Variation margin calls could
be substantial in the event of adverse price movements.

Using financial futures contracts involves various market risks. If the Fund
was unable to liquidate a futures position due to the absence of a liquid
secondary market or the imposition of price limits, it could incur substantial
losses and would continue to be subject to market risk with respect to the
position. In addition, the Fund would continue to be required to make variation
margin payments and might be required to maintain the position being hedged or
to maintain cash or securities in a separate account. Furthermore, certain
characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly
with movements in the prices of the investments

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

being hedged, including temporary price distortion. The separate account for
margin will be maintained at the futures counterparty and may be subject to
risks or delays if the counterparty becomes insolvent.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS--The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
agreements for hedging purposes. This type of swap is an agreement that
obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals
based upon or calculated by reference to a specified interest rate(s) for a
specified amount. The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with
the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the contract. The loss incurred by the
failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interest payment to
be received by the Fund. Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of
the counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.

The Fund accrues for interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis, with
the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap
contracts in the "Statement of assets and liabilities." Once interim payments
are settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps,
in addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of swap
contracts in the "Statement of operations." Fluctuations in the value of swap
contracts are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of swaps. At September 30, 2006, the Fund was not
invested in any interest rate swap agreements.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to
common shareholders at a rate level that over time will result in the
distribution of all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the
payment of dividends on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend
rate on the common stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate
of the Fund. Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on
the ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued
daily. The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions
from net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income
tax regulations, which may differ from US generally accepted accounting
principles. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital

accounts based on their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do
not require reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK
The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of,
municipal obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR
The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (Americas) Inc. ("UBS
Global AM"), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and
administrator of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset
management subsidiary of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization
with headquarters in Zurich and Basel, Switzerland and operations in many areas
of the financial services industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract,
the Fund pays UBS Global AM an investment advisory and administration fee,
which is accrued weekly and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the
Fund's average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and auction
preferred shares. For the period April 1, 2006 through July 31, 2006, UBS
Global AM had agreed to waive 0.30% of the advisory and administration fee, so
that the Fund's effective fee was 0.60% of average weekly net assets applicable
to holders of common and auction preferred shares. Effective August 1, 2006,
UBS Global AM agreed to further reduce the Fund's management fee so that the
Fund's effective fee for the period August 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006
was 0.83% of the Fund's average weekly net assets applicable only to holders of
common shares. This waiver will continue indefinitely unless the Board agrees
to any change. At September 30, 2006, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $210,357 in
investment advisory and administration fees, which is composed of $383,440 of
investment advisory and administration fees less fees waived of $173,083. For
the six months ended September 30, 2006, UBS Global AM waived $863,712 of
investment advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMPENSATION TO AFFILIATE OF A BOARD MEMBER
Effective March 1, 2005, Professor Meyer Feldberg accepted the position of
senior advisor to Morgan Stanley, resulting in him becoming an interested
director of the Fund. The Fund has been informed that Professor Feldberg's

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

role at Morgan Stanley does not involve matters directly affecting any UBS
funds. Fund transactions are executed through Morgan Stanley based on that
firm's ability to provide best execution of the transactions. During the six
months ended September 30, 2006, the Fund purchased and sold certain securities
(e.g., fixed income securities) in principal trades with Morgan Stanley having
an aggregate value of $19,914,382. Morgan Stanley received compensation in
connection with these trades, which may have been in the form of a "mark-up" or
"mark-down" of the price of the securities, a fee from the issuer for
maintaining a commercial paper program, or some other form of compensation.
Although the precise amount of this compensation is not generally known by UBS
Global AM, UBS Global AM believes that under normal circumstances it represents
a small portion of the total value of the transactions. In addition, Morgan
Stanley may participate as a broker-dealer in auctions for the Fund's auction
preferred shares and receive compensation therefore. Amounts received by Morgan
Stanley, if any, will vary depending upon that firm's participation in an
auction, and such amounts are calculated and paid by the auction agent from
money provided by the Fund.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES
The Fund has issued 800 shares of auction preferred shares Series A, 800 shares
of auction preferred shares Series B, 800 shares of auction preferred shares
Series C, 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series D, 600 shares of
auction preferred shares Series E and 600 shares of auction preferred shares
Series F, which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." All shares of
each series of APS have a liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an
amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, and/or capital gain distributions, which are cumulative, are
generally reset every 7 days for each Series of APS. Dividend rates ranged from
2.900% to 4.000% for the six months ended September 30, 2006.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law.
The holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES
For the six months ended September 30, 2006, aggregate purchases and sales of
portfolio securities, excluding short-term securities, were $88,623,036 and
$115,424,399, respectively.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS
The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income, net
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2006 was as follows:

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48).
FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time,
management is evaluating the implications of FIN 48, and its impact on the
financial statements has not yet been determined.

The Fund is not aware of any broker non-votes. (Broker non-votes are shares
held in street name for which the broker indicates that instructions have not
been received from the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote and
for which the broker does not have discretionary voting authority.) At the end
of September 2006, Mr. Beaubien retired from the Fund's board.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own
names, or in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have
all dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock
automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such
common shareholders elect to receive cash. Common shareholders who elect to
hold their shares in the name of another broker or nominee should contact such
broker or nominee to determine whether, or how, they may participate in the
Plan. The ability of such shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if
their shares are transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in

<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

the Plan may rejoin it at any time. Changes in elections must be made in
writing to the Fund's transfer agent and should include the shareholder's name
and address as they appear on the share certificate or in the transfer agent's
records. An election to terminate participation in the Plan, until such
election is changed, will be deemed an election by a common shareholder to take
all subsequent distributions in cash. An election will be effective only for
distributions declared and having a record date at least ten days after the
date on which the election is received.

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or
lower than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend
will be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend
payable to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including
applicable brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in
the open market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in
connection with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for
reinvesting dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for
handling the reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However,
each participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with
respect to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in
connection with the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment
of dividends and other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with
respect to any dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent
to Plan participants at least 30 days before the record date for such
distribution. The Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent
by at least 30 days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional
information regarding the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence
concerning the Plan should be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc.,
P.O. Box 43027, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information
regarding the Plan, you may also contact the transfer agent directly at
1-800-331 1710.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

BACKGROUND--At a meeting of the board of Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc.
(the "Fund") on July 19, 2006, the members of the board, including the
directors who are not "interested persons" of the Fund ("Independent
Directors"), as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"), considered and approved the continuance of the Investment Advisory
and Administration Agreement of the Fund with UBS Global Asset Management
(Americas) Inc. ("UBS Global AM"). In preparing for the meeting, the board
members had requested and received extensive information from UBS Global AM to
assist them, including performance and expense information for other investment
companies with similar investment objectives. The board received and considered
a variety of information about UBS Global AM, as well as the advisory and
administrative arrangements for the Fund. The Independent Directors discussed
the materials initially provided by management prior to the scheduled board
meeting in a session with their independent legal counsel and requested, and
received from management, supplemental materials to assist them in their
consideration of the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement. The
board received materials detailing the administrative services provided to the
Fund by UBS Global AM, which include providing accounting and financial
analysis, ensuring that all financial and tax regulatory reporting requirements
were met, certifying required Securities and Exchange Commission documentation
and monitoring the performance of the Fund's service providers.

The Independent Directors also met for several hours the evening before the
board meeting and met again after management's presentation was completed to
review the disclosure that had been made to them at the meeting. At all of
these sessions the Independent Directors met in session with their independent
legal counsel. The Independent Directors also received a memorandum from their
independent legal counsel discussing the duties of board members in considering
approval of advisory and administration agreements.

In its consideration of the approval of the Investment Advisory and
Administration Agreement, the board considered the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT--The board received and considered information
regarding the nature, extent and quality of management services provided to the
Fund by UBS Global AM (and its

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

predecessor, UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc.) under the Investment
Advisory and Administration Agreement during the past year. The board also
received a description of the administrative and other services rendered to the
Fund and its shareholders by UBS Global AM. The board considered the nature,
extent and quality of administrative and shareholder services performed by UBS
Global AM and its affiliates. The board also considered the resources devoted
to, and the record of compliance with, the Fund's compliance policies and
procedures. The board noted that it received information at regular meetings
throughout the year regarding the services rendered by UBS Global AM concerning
the management of the Fund's affairs and UBS Global AM's role in coordinating
providers of other services to the Fund, including custody, accounting and
transfer agency services. The board's evaluation of the services provided by
UBS Global AM took into account the board's knowledge and familiarity gained as
board members of funds in the UBS New York Fund complex, including the scope
and quality of UBS Global AM's investment management and other capabilities and
the quality of its administrative and other services. The board observed that
the scope of services provided by UBS Global AM had expanded over time as a
result of regulatory and other developments, including maintaining and
monitoring its own and the Fund's expanded compliance programs.

The board had available to it the qualifications, backgrounds and
responsibilities of the Fund's senior personnel at UBS Global AM and had
received information regarding the persons primarily responsible for the
day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund and recognized that the Fund's
senior personnel at UBS Global AM report to the board regularly, some at every
board meeting, and that at each regular meeting the board receives a report on
the Fund's performance. The board also considered, based on its knowledge of
UBS Global AM and its affiliates, the financial resources available to UBS
Global AM and its parent organization, UBS AG. In that regard, the board
received extensive financial information regarding UBS Global AM and noted that
it was a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of one of the largest financial
services firms in the world. It was also noted that UBS Global AM had well over
$100 billion in assets under management and was part of the UBS Global Asset
Management Division, which had over $600 billion of assets under management
worldwide.

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

The board reviewed how transactions in Fund assets are effected. The board also
reviewed the Fund's brokerage policies and practices, the standards applied in
seeking best execution, policies and practices regarding soft dollars, the use
of a broker affiliated with UBS Global AM and the existence of quality controls
applicable to brokerage allocation procedures. In addition, UBS Global AM also
reported to the board on, among other things, its disaster recovery plans and
portfolio manager compensation plan.

The board concluded that, overall, it was satisfied with the nature, extent and
quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to the Fund under
the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement.

ADVISORY FEES AND EXPENSE RATIOS--The board reviewed and considered the
contractual management fee ("Contractual Management Fee") payable by the Fund
to UBS Global AM in light of the nature, extent and quality of the advisory and
administrative services provided by UBS Global AM. The board also reviewed and
considered the fee waiver arrangement in place for the Fund and considered the
actual fee rate (after taking any waivers into account) (the "Actual Management
Fee"). Additionally, the board received and considered information comparing
the Fund's Contractual Management Fee, Actual Management Fee and overall
expenses with those of funds in a group of funds selected and provided by
Lipper, Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent provider of investment company data
(the "Expense Group").

In connection with its consideration of the Fund's advisory fees, the board
also received information on UBS Global AM's standard institutional account
fees for accounts of a similar investment type to the Fund. The board noted
that, in general, these fees were lower than the Contractual Management Fee and
Actual Management Fee for the Fund, but also noted management's explanation
that comparisons with such accounts may be of limited relevance given the
different structures and regulatory requirements of mutual funds versus such
accounts and the differences in the levels of services required by mutual funds
and such accounts. The board also received information on fees charged to other
mutual funds managed by UBS Global AM.

In addition to the Contractual and Actual Management Fees, the board also
reviewed and considered the total expenses for the Fund. The comparative

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              41
<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

Lipper information showed that the Fund's Contractual Management Fee, Actual
Management Fee and total expenses were in the fifth quintile in the Fund's
Expense Group for the comparison periods utilized in the Lipper report (with
the first quintile representing that fifth of the funds in the Expense Group
with the lowest level of fees or expenses, as applicable, and the fifth
quintile representing that fifth of the funds in the Expense Group with the
highest level of fees or expenses, as applicable). In light of the level of the
Fund's fees and expenses, management proposed a revision in the management fee
such that the management fee will be calculated only on the value of the net
assets attributable to the Fund's common shares, rather than the net assets
attributable to both the Fund's common and preferred shares. Management noted
that this change should result in an anticipated reduction in the Fund's Actual
Management Fee to 0.83% of net assets applicable to common shares from its
current level of 1.005%, which would be at the median of its Expense Group.
Management also explained that it had negotiated a reduction in the Fund's
custodian fees such that the custodian fee rate will be based only on assets
attributable to common shares and not on assets attributable to both common and
preferred shares. Combined, these modifications should result in an anticipated
reduction in the Fund's total expenses to approximately 0.99% of net assets
applicable to common shares from its current level of 1.199%, which is below
the median of its Expense Group.

Taking all of the above into consideration, including the proposed reductions
in the advisory fee and custodian fees, the board determined that the
management fee was reasonable in light of the nature, extent and quality of the
services provided to the Fund under the Investment Advisory and Administration
Agreement.

FUND PERFORMANCE--The board received and considered performance information of
the Fund compared to other funds (the "Performance Universe") selected by
Lipper over the one-, three-, five-, ten-year and since inception periods ended
April 30, 2006. The board was provided with a description of the methodology
Lipper used to determine the similarity of the Fund with the funds included in
its Performance Universe. The board also noted that it had received
information throughout the year at periodic intervals with respect to the
Fund's performance, including in most cases with respect to its benchmark index.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42
<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

The comparative Lipper information showed that the Fund's performance was in
the fourth quintile for the one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods and in the
fifth quintile since inception (with the first quintile representing that fifth
of the funds in the Performance Universe with the highest performance and the
fifth quintile representing that fifth of the funds in the Performance Universe
with the lowest performance). In its review, the board noted the Fund's
performance as compared to the average return for the Fund's Performance
Universe and benchmark index, taking the volatility in returns for the
Performance Universe and the index into account. In addition, the board noted
that in the past the Fund has been managed with a more conservative view when
compared to its Performance Universe. Management noted that, as had been
approved by the Board, it had taken certain steps to increase the Fund's
exposure to interest rates by increasing the average life of the investments
that it holds by one year. Management also noted that the Fund has increased
its investment in lower quality issues within its allotted 20% non-insured,
investment grade "bucket" and added approximately 8% exposure to AMT
securities. Management explained that it believed that these initiatives were
positive contributors to the Fund's performance and should make the Fund more
competitive in the future as compared to its Performance Group. Management
also noted that over the trailing 12 months, as of May 31, 2006, the Fund
outperformed the Lipper median by 10 basis points before fees. Based on its
review, and management's explanation and changes to the investment strategies
of the Fund, the board concluded that the Fund's investment performance was
acceptable.

ADVISER PROFITABILITY--The board received and considered a profitability
analysis of UBS Global AM and its affiliates in providing services to the Fund.
The board also received profitability information with respect to the UBS New
York fund complex as a whole. In addition, the board received information with
respect to UBS Global AM's allocation methodologies used in preparing this
profitability data. UBS Global AM's profitability was considered not excessive
in light of the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE--The board received and considered information from
management regarding whether it has achieved economies of scale with respect to
the management of the Fund, whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from
any economies of scale, and whether there is potential realization of further
economies of scale. The board considered

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              43
<PAGE>

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

BOARD APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

whether economies of scale in the provision of services to the Fund were being
passed along to shareholders. The board also considered whether alternative fee
structures (such as breakpoints) would be more appropriate or reasonable taking
into consideration economies of scale or other efficiencies.

In conducting its review, the board noted that the Fund's Contractual
Management Fee did not contain any breakpoints. Further, the board noted that
advisory agreements of closed-end funds usually do not contain breakpoints.
Management informed the board that the Fund, as a closed-end investment
company, was not expected to materially increase in size; thus, UBS Global AM
would not benefit from economies of scale. The Board members considered whether
economies of scale could be realized because UBS Global AM advises other
similar funds, and, based on their experience, the board accepted UBS Global
AM's explanation that significant economies of scale would not be realized
because the nature of the market in which the Fund invests did not provide
significant savings.

OTHER BENEFITS TO UBS GLOBAL AM--The board considered other benefits received
by UBS Global AM and its affiliates as a result of its relationship with the
Fund, including the opportunity to offer additional products and services to
Fund shareholders.

In light of the costs of providing investment management, administrative and
other services to the Fund and UBS Global AM's ongoing commitment to the Fund,
the profits and other ancillary benefits that UBS Global AM and its affiliates
received were considered reasonable.

In light of all of the foregoing, the board approved the Advisory and
Administration Agreement to continue for another year.

In making its decision, the board identified no single factor as being
determinative in approving the Investment Advisory and Administration
Agreement. The Independent Directors were advised by separate independent legal
counsel throughout the entire process. The board discussed the proposed
continuance of the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement in a
private session with their independent legal counsel at which no
representatives of UBS Global AM were present.
