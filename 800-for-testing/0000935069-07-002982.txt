NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

1.   ORGANIZATION

     Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
     (the  "Company" or "Fund") was  organized as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
     Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered  under the Investment
     Company  Act  of  1940  (the  "1940  Act")  as  amended,  as a  closed-end,
     non-diversified   management   investment  company.  The  Company  is  also
     registered  under the  Securities  Act of 1933  ("1933  Act").  The Company
     consisted  of two separate  series,  Series M and  Multi-Strategy  Series G
     (each a "Series").  On December 31, 2006,  Multi-Strategy Series G ("Series
     G")  acquired  all of the  Shareholders'  Capital of Series M pursuant to a
     plan of  reorganization  and  merger  approved  by  Series  G and  Series M
     shareholders  on November 29,  2006.  The Company  currently  consists of a
     single series, Series G.

     The  investment  objective of Series G is to achieve  capital  appreciation
     principally  through  investing in investment  funds  ("Investment  Funds")
     managed by third-party  investment  managers  ("Investment  Managers") that
     employ a variety of alternative  investment  strategies.  These  investment
     strategies  allow  Investment  Managers the  flexibility to use leverage or
     short-side positions to take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies  across
     the global markets, often referred to as "alternative" strategies.  Because
     Investment  Funds  following  alternative  investment  strategies are often
     described  as  hedge  funds,  the  investment  program  of  Series G can be
     described as a fund of hedge funds.

     Shares  of  Series  G  are  sold  to  eligible  investors  (referred  to as
     "shareholders").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in  Series G from each
     shareholder is $25,000 (and was $50,000 from January 1, 2003 to November 1,
     2003); the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

     Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC ("CAI" or the "Adviser"),  a Delaware
     limited  liability  company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
     Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as Series G's investment  adviser.  The Adviser is
     registered as an investment  adviser under the  Investment  Advisers Act of
     1940,  as  amended,  and,  among  other  things,  is  responsible  for  the
     allocation of Series G's assets to various  Investment Funds.  Under Series
     G's  governing  documents,  the Company  has  delegated  substantially  all
     authority to oversee the  management of the operations and assets of Series
     G to the Board of Directors.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms of the respective
     limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company agreements and
     offering memoranda.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Series G values these  investments  at fair value based on  financial  data
     supplied by the Investment Funds.

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The net asset value of Series G is  determined  as of the close of business
     at the end of each month in accordance  with the valuation  principles  set
     forth below or as may be determined  from time to time pursuant to policies
     established by the Board of Directors.

     Series G's  investments  in  Investment  Funds are carried at fair value as
     determined  by  Series  G's  pro-rata  interest  in the net  assets of each
     Investment Fund. All valuations utilize financial  information  supplied by
     each Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
     fees or other  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers as
     required by the Investment Funds'  agreements.  Each Investment  Manager to
     which the Adviser  allocates assets will charge Series G, as investor in an
     underlying  Investment  Fund,  an  asset-based  fee, and some or all of the
     Investment Managers will receive performance-based compensation in the form
     of an incentive fee. The  asset-based  fees of the Investment  Managers are
     generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the net assets under
     their management and the incentive fee is generally  expected to range from
     15% to 25% of net profits annually.

     As a  general  matter,  the  fair  value of  Series  G's  investment  in an
     Investment Fund  represents the amount that Series G can reasonably  expect
     to receive from an Investment  Fund if Series G's investment  were redeemed
     at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time. The
     Investment Funds provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from monthly to
     annually.   Investment   Funds  generally   require  advance  notice  of  a
     Sharholder's  intent to redeem  its  interest,  and may,  depending  on the
     Investment Funds' governing agreements, deny or delay a redemption request.
     Series G does not factor into its  valuation  a  liquidity  discount on any
     Investment  Funds held. The underlying  investments of each Investment Fund
     are  accounted  for at fair value as  described in each  Investment  Fund's
     financial  statements.  The Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their
     assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid.

     B. INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

     Interest  income is recorded on the accrual  basis.  Income,  expenses  and
     realized and unrealized gains and losses are recoded monthly, the change in
     an  Investment  Fund's  net  asset  value  is  included  in net  change  in
     unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  on the statement of  operations,
     realized  gains  and  losses  on  withdrawals  from  Investment  Funds  are
     recognized on a cost recovery basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Series G bears all  expenses  incurred  in the  course  of its  operations,
     including,  but not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses
     related to portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for Series G's account;
     professional fees; costs of insurance;  registration expenses; and expenses
     of meetings of the Board of Directors.  Costs  incurred in connection  with
     the initial  offering  were  deferred and  amortized  over the first twelve
     months  of  operations;  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  Series  G's
     subsequent  registration  under  the 1933 Act have been  deferred  and were
     amortized  over the twelve months  commencing  after the effective  date of
     such registration statement.

     C. INCOME TAXES

     Series G operated as a partnership  from  inception  through  September 30,
     2005. As of October 1, 2005, Series G became a corporation that is taxed as
     a regulated investment company.

     It is Series G's intention to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue
     Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies  (RIC) and  distribute
     substantially  all of its taxable net investment  income and capital gains,
     if any, to shareholders each year.  Therefore,  no federal income or excise
     tax provision is typically required for Series G's financial statements.

     D. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist  of  monies  invested  in money  market
     deposit accounts that are accounted for at amortized cost.

     E. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  Series G's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In July 2006, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
     Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting  for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
     Interpretation  of FASB  Statement  No.  109" (the  "Interpretation").  The
     Interpretation  establishes  for  all  entities  a  minimum  threshold  for
     financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing
     tax  returns  (including  whether  an entity  is  taxable  in a  particular
     jurisdiction), and requires certain

                                     - 10 -

CITIGROUP ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     expanded tax disclosures.  The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years
     beginning  after  December 15,  2006,  and is to be applied to all open tax
     years as of the date of effectiveness.  The Adviser is still evaluating the
     impact of Fin 48 and does not expect it to have a material impact on Series
     G's financial statements.

     In  September  2006,  the FASB issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
     Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  157,  FAIR  VALUE  MEASUREMENTS.   This  standard
     establishes a single authoritative  definition of fair value and sets out a
     framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
     measurements.  SFAS No.  157  applies to fair  value  measurements  already
     required or permitted by existing standards.

     SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial  statements issued for fiscal years
     beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those fiscal
     years.  The  Adviser  does not  believe  the  adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
     materially  impact the financial  statement  amounts;  however,  additional
     disclosures  will  be  required  about  the  inputs  used  to  develop  the
     measurements  and  the  effect  of  certain   measurements  on  changes  in
     Shareholders' Capital for the period.

4.   MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

     The Adviser  provides  certain  management and  administrative  services to
     Series G. The Adviser  acts  primarily  to evaluate  and select  Investment
     Managers,  to  allocate  assets,  to  establish  and apply risk  management
     procedures, and to monitor overall investment performance. In addition, the
     Adviser  also  provides  office  space  and  other  support  services.   In
     consideration  for such  services,  Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly
     management fee based on end of month Shareholders' capital.

     Effective  August 1, 2005,  the Board of Directors  approved a reduction in
     the management fee to 1.5% of net assets annually (from 2.25% annually).

     Placement  agents may be retained by the Company to assist in the placement
     of Fund shares.  A placement  agent will generally be entitled to receive a
     fee from each investor in the Company  whose shares the agent  places.  The
     specific  amount of the placement fee paid with respect to a Shareholder is
     generally dependent on the size of the investment in Series G.

     Citigroup Global Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a wholly
     owned  subsidiary of  Citigroup,  Inc.  serves as a placement  agent of the
     Series  G  shares.  For  the six  months  ended  September  30,  2007,  the
     Shareholders  paid  $498,967 in  placement  fees to CGM on Series G shares.
     Such fees are deducted from a Shareholder's gross contribution amount.

     The  Company  has  entered  into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
     additional  placement agents for Series G shares.  Placement fees may range
     from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser, and/or its affiliates, will pay the
     placement agents an annual fee,  payable monthly in arrears.  The fee shall
     be paid from the Adviser's own resources (or those of its affiliates).

     CAI and PFPC Inc. ("PFPC) act as  co-administrators  to the Company. CAI as
     co-administrator,  does  not  receive  fees  for  providing  administrative
     services to the Company.  PFPC, an independent third party and wholly-owned
     subsidiary  of  the  PNC  Financial   Services   Group   provides   certain
     administrative  services  to  the  Company  including  accounting,   record
     keeping,  tax and investor  related  services.  Fees for PFPC  services are
     charged directly to the Company.

     Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Company, as defined
     by the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus a fee per
     meeting of the Board of Directors of $1,000. Such Director fees are paid by
     Series G. Any Director who is an  "interested  person" does not receive any
     annual or other fee from the Company.  All Directors are reimbursed for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses. Total Director fees paid by Series G for
     the six months ended September 30, 2007 were $21,000.

     PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PFPC) serves as custodian of Series G's
     assets and  provides  custodial  services for Series G. Fees payable to the
     custodian and reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Series G.

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which Series G
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not limited to, short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts and
     entering  into equity  swaps.  Series G's risk of loss in these  investment
     funds is limited to the value of it's investment in such funds.

     with an unaffiliated bank for a $125,000,000 revolving credit facility (the
     "Credit  Facility").  The Credit  Facility will be used in connection  with
     investment activities, for cash management purposes, to fund the repurchase
     of shares or for  temporary  or emergency  purposes as permitted  under the
     Offering  Memorandum.  The Credit Facility is secured by Series G's assets.
     At September 30, 2007, the  outstanding  borrowing from the Credit Facility
     amounted to $6,100,000, bearing interest at a rate of 7.75% less a discount
     percentage per annum. Interest payable on the outstanding borrowing for the
     semi-annual  period ended September 30, 2007 was $266,336,  with the entire
     balance due at September 30, 2007.
