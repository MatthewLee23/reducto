Dear Shareowners,
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe a desirable, moderate slowing of U.S. economic growth appears
likely, with beneficial impacts on inflation and interest rates, while global
growth prospects remain strong. We base this on the events of the six and 12
month periods ending May 31, 2006 that have been characterized by strong global
growth, rising commodity and stock prices, and rising interest rates. While
markets reversed in May (U.S. Treasury bond yields, stock markets, and
commodity prices all turned down), we believe the basic fundamental pattern of
steady global economic growth remains intact.

According to the International Monetary Fund, global economic growth in 2004-5
was the fastest of any two-year period in more than 30 years, and 2006 growth
is projected to match the healthy growth of 2005. This growth has been
broad-based, with Europe, Japan, and emerging market economies all showing
strength. The result has been rising prices across a broad range of
commodities, rising corporate profits, and rising interest rates. These basic
ingredients are fueling the equity bull market and the relatively weak bond
market over the six months ending May 31, 2006.

The bond markets' concern has been that strong economic growth would spark
inflation - we have already seen commodity prices rise, and U.S. labor costs
are threatening to increase since we are close to full employment. An
environment of strong economic growth, rising commodity prices and labor
demands may lead to inflation and higher interest rates; therefore a slower
growing economy would be welcomed by the markets.

While first quarter economic growth was strong, it looks as if the slowdown in
the U.S. economy for the second half of the year may be starting to unfold. The
positive unemployment figures, which reached a five-year low of 4.6 percent in
April, may have peaked as the number of new jobs fell in this period, the
smallest increase since the Katrina-distorted result of October 2005. The
cooling of housing market sales so far this year is another indicator of a
slowing economy.

The U.S. Federal Reserve ("Fed") has continued its measured short-term interest
rate increases. With global commodity prices continuing to rise, the Fed warned
in May that it remains vigilant in wanting to keep inflation low. This
determination puts short-term pressure on

Letter


markets, but such action has a positive effect for consumers over the
intermediate-to-longer term. By restraining inflation, the Fed may also limit
upward pressure on longer-maturity bond yields and downward pressure on stocks'
price/earnings ratios.

In summary, we think security market valuations remain reasonable. However,
there are no guarantees in investing. We know from a long view of history that
sudden shifts in investor sentiment can occur with little warning. This
unpredictability reinforces the importance of Pioneer's message that investors
should remain diversified, take a long-term view, and base investment decisions
on economic and market fundamentals, rather than on emotion. Our investment
philosophy and approach continue to be based on the use of fundamental research
to identify a range of opportunities that offer an attractive balance of risk
and reward to help Trust shareowners work toward their long-term goals.

Respectfully,

/s/ Osbert M. Hood

     Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
     month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher
     than the performance data quoted.

     Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
     guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will
     fluctuate, and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to
     such factors as interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of
     borrowers.

     Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or
     commissions. All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

     Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
     There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end
     funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
     trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV is total assets less total
     liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of
     common shares outstanding.

     When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested
     at the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher,
     dividends are assumed to be reinvested at market price.

     The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and
     taxes that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption
     of Trust shares.

     Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is
     designed to mirror the investable universe of the $US-denominated leveraged
     loan market. As of March 30, 2001, the Index included $148 billion in
     tradable term loans. Index returns are calculated monthly, assume
     reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
     fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot invest directly in an Index.

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/06
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This semiannual report for Pioneer Floating Rate Trust covers the six-month
period from December 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006. In the report, portfolio
managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital Management discuss
the Trust's investment process, strategy and outlook.

Q:   How did the Trust perform over the last six months?

A:   For the six-month period ended May 31, 2006, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
     returned 6.70% at net asset value. The market price return over that same
     six-month period was 12.67%. The Trust's benchmark, the Credit Suisse
     Leveraged Loan Index, returned 3.52% for the same period. At the end of
     May, the Trust was selling at a discount of market price to net asset value
     of -5.14%. Unlike open-ended funds, a closed-end fund's price goes up and
     down based on supply and demand, irrespective of a fund's net asset value
     per share. It isn't unusual to find closed-end funds trading at a discount.
     At the end of the period, closed-end funds on average were trading at a
     discount to their actual underlying value.

     During the six-month period, the federal funds target rate rose to 5.0%
     from 4.0%. During this same period, the yield on the 3-month London
     Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) rose from 4.42% to 5.24%. LIBOR is the rate
     of interest at which banks borrow funds from other banks, in marketable
     size, in the London Interbank market.

     Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
     month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher
     than the performance data quoted.

     The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no
     guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will
     fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their
     original cost.

Q:   What was the investment environment like during the six months?

A:   The investment environment during the six months ended May 31, 2006, was
     generally favorable for the leveraged loan markets, as demand for leveraged
     loans was strong. There was a healthy supply of new bank loan issuance, and
     default rates on current loans declined slightly. Yields on loans, as
     tracked by the Credit Suisse

                                                                               7

     Leveraged Loan Index, narrowed from 2.58% at the end of November 2005 to
     2.49% at the end of May 2006. However, the tightening in yields was more
     than offset by the increase in LIBOR. From December 1, 2005 through May 31,
     2006, the three-month LIBOR rose approximately 0.82%. As a result, the
     average coupon rate for leveraged loans, as tracked by the Credit Suisse
     Leveraged Loan Index, rose from 6.81% to 7.60% during the same period.

Q:   What were the principal investment strategies used in managing the Trust?

A:   Our strategies for managing the Trust were driven by our beliefs that the
     economy is healthy and that the leveraged loan markets will perform well
     during the first half of 2006. We continued to keep the portfolio fully
     invested by using available cash to add newly issued loans that we felt
     would trade higher in the secondary markets. The Trust was highly
     diversified, with positions in 194 issuers. About 94.5% of total
     investments were in loans, 3.1% in bonds and 0.9% in equities.
     Approximately 11.2% of the Trust was in second lien loans. We understand
     the risk inherent in second liens and closely monitor these investments.
     From a risk/reward perspective, we believe second lien loans can increase
     the Trust's yield without taking on too much added risk.

     With regard to diversification, the Trust was invested in approximately 26
     industries. Some core positions included: Millennium Digital Media, a
     broadband services company; Resorts International Holdings, a gaming
     company; and Cricket Communications, a wireless communications service. The
     cable/wireless video, retail, and telecommunications industries were among
     the largest industries in the portfolio.

Q:   In February the monthly dividend rose to $0.13 per share, and in April the
     dividend increased to $0.14 per share. What accounted for these increases?

A:   We were able to keep the Trust's yield relatively stable. The Trust's
     average yield on floating-rate loans increased from 3.64% on November 30,
     2005 to approximately 3.65% on May 31, 2006. A low default rate and an
     increase in LIBOR, as noted above, also contributed to our ability to
     increase the dividend.

Q:   What is your outlook?

A:   We think the leveraged loan market will continue to perform well during the
     remainder of 2006. While we believe defaults should move up slightly during
     the remainder of the year, we think they should continue to be below the
     historical average. We expect demand for loans to remain strong. Overall,
     our view is that the economy is healthy, and we do not expect any material
     decreases in the credit quality of the portfolio.

     Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained
     in the Trust's original prospectus. Please refer to this document when
     considering the Trust's risks.

     Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
     greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
     that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

     When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the
     Trust will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices
     of fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating
     rate feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
     appreciation in a declining interest rate environment. Investments in the
     Trust are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers
     of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt
     obligations.

     The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
     and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

     The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
     invested in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
     Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the
     times when the trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market
     price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities.
     Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the
     Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
     take advantage of market opportunities.

     The Trust may use leverage through the issuance of preferred shares with an
     aggregate liquidation preference of up to 331/3% of the Trust's total
     assets after such issuance. Leverage creates significant risks, including
     the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
     sufficient to cover the cost of

                                                                               9

     leverage, which may adversely affect the return for the holders of common
     shares.

     The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
     percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being
     non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
     affecting a particular issuer.

     Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic
     trends or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future
     performance are statements of the opinion of the Trust's sub-advisors as of
     the date of this report. These statements should not be relied upon for any
     other purposes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and
     there is no guarantee that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware business
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 23, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the sale and issuance
to Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc., an affiliate of Pioneer Investment
Management, Inc. ("PIM"), the Trust's investment adviser, a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano S.p.A. (UniCredito Italiano), of
5,240 shares of beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,084.
PIM has paid all the Trust's organizational expenses and has paid the amount by
which the aggregate offering costs (other than the sales load) exceeded $0.04
per share of the common share offering. The investment objective of the Trust
is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a secondary
objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its
primary goal of high current income.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The
Trust may invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality,
including Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment
grade, or are unrated but are determined by the investment subadviser to be of
equivalent credit quality.

Debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as "junk
bonds" and are considered speculative. These securities involve greater risk of
loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less liquid, especially
during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt
securities.

Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.

32
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times
when the trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is
generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid
securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the Trust's
assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Trust's investments in foreign markets or countries with limited developing
markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a developed
market. These risks include disruptive political or economic conditions and the
possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange
restrictions.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus. Please refer to those documents when considering
the Trust's risks. At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries
or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more
susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other
risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:


A.   Security Valuation

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior Loans are
     valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of Trustees
     at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or
     more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
     limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes are
     available, such Senior Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
     through the use of pricing

                                                                              33
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/06 (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     matrices to determine valuations. If Loan Pricing Corporation does not
     provide a value for the Senior Loans, the investment sub-adviser will value
     the Senior Loans at fair value, which is intended to approximate market
     value.

     Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained
     from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued
     at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded.
     Securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at
     their fair values as determined by, or under the direction of, the Board of
     Trustees. Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day
     at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such
     securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are
     determined as of such times. The Trust may also use the fair value of a
     security, including a non-U.S. security, when the closing market price on
     the primary exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately
     reflects the value of the security as of the close of the exchange. At May
     31, 2006, the Trust held no fair valued securities. Temporary cash
     investments are valued at amortized cost.

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discount and premium on debt
     securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an effective
     yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income. Interest
     income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is recorded on
     an accrual basis.

     Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
     cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

34
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
     among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
     contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between the
     amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received. Further,
     the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments
     are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of
     changes in market price of those securities but are included with the net
     realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
     shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

     The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
     financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
     income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may be
     shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess
     of net investment income or net realized gain on investment transactions,
     or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax differences that
     may exist.

     The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
     preferred shareowners will be determined at the end of the fiscal year.
     Distributions during the period ended November 30, 2005 were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

     The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation is
     primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
     methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities.

D.   Repurchase Agreements

     With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
     of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
     received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
     excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
     for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
     account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. PIM is responsible for
     determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
     repurchase price.

E.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
     dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
     full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners
     may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in
     the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
     Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
     resumed at any time without penalty by notifying Mellon Investor Services
     LLC, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan
     Agent"), in writing prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
     termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any
     subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

36
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
     acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
     unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
     outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
     on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share
     is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
     brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
     common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing
     the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share
     on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from
     the then current market price per share on the date of issuance does not
     exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value
     per common share is greater than the market value ("market discount"), the
     Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in
     open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly
     issued common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share
     of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
     open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another broker
     and continue to participate in the Plan.

2.   Management Agreement

The Trust has entered into an advisory agreement with PIM. Management fees are
calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily value of the Trust's total
assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which liabilities exclude debt
related to leverage, short-term debt and the aggregate liquidation preference of
any outstanding preferred shares. At May 31, 2006, $420,564 was payable to PIM
related to management fees.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. For the six
months ended May 31, 2006, the Trust

                                                                              37
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/06 (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

recorded $16,677 in reimbursement, which is included in "Administration fees and
reimbursement" on the Statement of Operations.

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments. Under
the terms of the sub-advisory agreement, for its services, the Sub-adviser is
entitled to a sub-advisory fee from PIM at an annual rate of 0.35% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. The fee is paid monthly in arrears. The
Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

The Trust has entered into an administration agreement with PIM pursuant to
which PIM will provide certain administrative and accounting services to the
Trust. PIM has appointed Princeton Administrators, L.P. ("Princeton") as the
sub-administrator to the Trust to perform certain of PIM's administration and
accounting obligations to the Trust. Under the administration agreement, the
Trust pays PIM a monthly fee equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in
excess of $500 million. PIM and not the Trust, is responsible for paying the
fees of Princeton.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations to limit the Trust's total annual expenses [excluding offering costs
for common and preferred shares, interest expense, the cost of defending or
prosecuting any claim or litigation to which the Trust is a party (together
with any amount in judgment or settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes
incurred due to the failure of the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Code or any other non-recurring or non-operating expenses] to
0.95% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. The dividend on any
preferred shares is not an expense for this purpose. For the six months ended
May 31, 2006, the Trust's expenses were not reduced under such arrangements.

PIM has reimbursed the Trust $99,422 for an excise tax expense.

3.   Expense Offset Arrangements

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion
of the Trusts custodian expenses. For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the
Trust expenses were reduced by $143 under such arrangement.

4.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver currencies
at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust must make
delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of
a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by entering into an
offsetting hedge contract. At May 31, 2006, the Trust had no outstanding
portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

5.   Unfunded Loan Commitments:

As of May 31, 2006, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of approximately
$6,091,193 which could be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to
the following loan agreements:

owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredito Italiano, through a sub-transfer agency
agreement with Mellon Investor Services LLC, provides substantially all transfer
agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at negotiated
rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the transfer agent, registrar,
dividend paying agent and redemption agent with respect to the Trust's Auction
Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). The Trust pays Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, for providing such services.

Offering costs of $973,000 incurred in connection with the Trust's
offering of common shares have been charged to paid-in capital.

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of May 31, 2006, there were 9,380 AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series
W7-3,125 and Series TH7-3,125. Offering costs of $404,494 and underwriting
discounts of $2,345,000 have been charged to paid-in capital.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates
ranged from 3.95% to 4.85% during the six months ended May 31, 2006.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS

40

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

are also subject to mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any
accumulated or unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, if certain
requirements relating to the composition of the assets and liabilities of the
Trust as set forth in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required
to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the

 PIONEER TrustS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Trusts recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Trusts recognize that a Trust's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge
of the Trusts, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Trust personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Trusts. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Trust's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Trusts when retaining the independent audit
firm to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Trust shall also
constitute approval for any other Trust whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Trust's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Trusts and the Trust's auditors will
  each make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not
  impair independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

N/A


(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

N/A


(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Trust's independent auditor, Ernst &
Young LLP ("E&Y"), has advised the Audit
Committee of the Trust's Board of Trustees that
E&Ys Spanish affiliate (E&Y Spain) performed
certain non-audit work for Pioneer Global
Investments Limited ("PGIL"), an affiliate of the
Trusts investment adviser.  The services involved
the receipt and disbursement of monies transferred
to E&Y Spain by PGIL in payment of individual
payroll and related income tax withholdings due on
returns prepared by E&Y Spain for certain PGIL
employees located in Spain from February 2001 to
October 2005.  E&Y became auditors of the Trust in
May 2002.  These payroll and tax services were
discontinued in November 2005.  The annual fee
received by E&Y Spain for all such services totaled
approximately 9,000 Euro per year. E&Y has informed
the Audit Committee that based on its internal
reviews and the de minimus nature of the services
provided and fees received, E&Y does not believe
its independence with respect to the Trust has been
impaired or that it is disqualified from acting as
independent auditors to the Trust.
