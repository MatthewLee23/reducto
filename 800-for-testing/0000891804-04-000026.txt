Sidebar text: WE THINK YOUR NUVEEN FUND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK IN A
PORTFOLIO DESIGNED TO PERFORM WELL THROUGH A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS.


Dear
  SHAREHOLDER

I am very pleased to report that for the year ended October 31, 2003, your
Nuveen Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free income.

Your Nuveen Fund is managed with a value investing strategy that puts an
emphasis on finding securities that we think are undervalued or underrated. We
believe that there are always some municipal bonds that the market is not
properly valuing, and that by using a consistent, research-oriented management
approach we have the opportunity to find them for your Fund.

In this low-rate environment, many have begun to wonder whether interest rates
will soon start to rise, and whether that possibility should cause them to
adjust their holdings of fixed-income investments. We believe that by
constructing a carefully balanced portfolio with the help of a trusted
investment professional you may be able to reduce your overall investment risk
and give yourself a better chance to meet your financial goals. We think that
municipal bond investments like your Nuveen Fund can be important building
blocks in a portfolio designed to perform well through a variety of market
conditions.

Since 1898, Nuveen Investments has offered financial products and solutions that
incorporate careful research, diversification, and the application of
conservative risk-management principles. We are grateful that you have chosen us
as a partner as you pursue your financial goals. We look forward to continuing
to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Chairman of the Board

(NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, NXZ, NZF)

Portfolio Manager's
                COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom Spalding discusses U.S. economic and market conditions,
key investment strategies, and the annual performance of these national Funds.
With 27 years of investment experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ since its
inception in 2001, adding NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and NZF in January 2003.



WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE 12-MONTH
PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2003?

Over the 12-month reporting period the two greatest influences on the general
economy continued to be historically low interest rates and the overall pace of
economic improvement. In June 2003, the Federal Reserve reduced the fed funds
rate to 1.0%, the lowest level since 1958. The Fed's accommodative monetary
policy coupled with Washington's tax relief measures and increased spending for
defense helped to fuel an 8.2% year-over-year jump in the third-quarter Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), up from 3.3% in the second quarter. At the same time,
inflation remained under control throughout the period.

In the municipal market, the slower rate of economic recovery over the majority
of this reporting period, low interest rates, and lack of inflationary pressures
helped many municipal bonds perform well. During the summer of 2003, however,
stronger-than-expected economic data precipitated a spike in bond yields and a
corresponding drop in bond prices that impacted results across all fixed-income
markets, including the municipal market, for the 12-month period ended October
31, 2003.

During the first 10 months of 2003, municipal supply nationally remained robust,
with $319.9 billion in new bonds, up 8% over the same period in 2002.

HOW DID THESE NUVEEN FUNDS PERFORM OVER THIS REPORTING PERIOD?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as for relevant benchmarks, are

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, all six of the Funds in this report
outperformed the unleveraged Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. NMA, NMO, NAD
and NXZ also outperformed their Lipper peer group average, while NPP and NZF
trailed this measure. The use of leverage was one of the factors that influenced
the performances of these Funds relative to the Lehman index over the past 12
months. While this

1 The total annual returns on common share net asset value (NAV) for these
  Nuveen Funds are compared with the total annual return of the Lehman Brothers
  Municipal Bond Index, an unleveraged, unmanaged index comprising a broad range
  of investment-grade municipal bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not
  reflect any expenses.

2 The total returns of these Funds are compared with the average annualized
  return of the 62 funds in the Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds
  category. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of dividends.

3 The taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
  taxable investment, other than an investment that generates qualified dividend
  income taxable at a maximum rate of 15%, in order to equal the yield of the
  Nuveen Fund on an after-tax basis. It is calculated using the current market
  yield and a federal income tax rate of 28%.


                                       2

is a strategy that carries price risk and additional volatility, leveraging can
provide opportunities for additional income for common shareholders, especially
during periods of low short-term interest rates.

In general, the Funds also benefited from their duration4 positioning during
this period. As of October 31, 2003, the durations of these Funds ranged from
8.94 to 10.22, compared with 8.22 for the Lehman index. These durations were
long enough to enable these Funds to benefit as interest rates declined during
most of the 12-month reporting period and short enough to offer some protection
as interest rates rose in recent months. In general, investments with longer
durations would be expected to outperform those with shorter durations during
periods of declining interest rates, all other factors being equal.

In addition to leverage and duration, factors such as call exposure, portfolio
trading activity, and the price movement of specific sectors and holdings also
had an impact on the Funds' relative performances during this period. For
example, at the beginning of this reporting period, NPP held a higher
concentration of airline-backed bonds than the other five Funds. In recent
months, airline bonds started to rebound, recovering much of their value.
Because we had already begun to trim NPP's airline allocation to bring it more
in line with the other Funds, the Fund did not benefit from the recovery of
these bonds to the extent that the others did.

HOW DID THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates remaining at historically low levels, the
dividend-paying capabilities of all of these Funds benefited from their use of
leverage. During the 12 months ended October 31, 2003, continued low short-term
rates enabled us to implement three dividend increases in NPP, NAD, and NXZ, two
in NMA and NZF, and one in NMO.

Even at these dividend levels, each Fund's common share net investment income
during the period exceeded the amount of dividends paid to common shareholders.
This excess net investment income, along with any excess net investment income
from prior fiscal periods, was held in reserve by the Funds as undistributed net
investment income (UNII) and is part of the Funds' net asset value. The Funds,
over time, will pay all their net investment income out to common shareholders.
However, UNII reserves may help the Funds maintain more stable common share
dividend levels over time should the short-term rates the Funds pay on their
MuniPreferred shares rise or net common share earnings otherwise decline.

4 Duration is a measure of a fund's NAV volatility in reaction to interest rate
  movements. Fund duration, also known as leverage-adjusted duration, takes into
  account the leveraging process for a fund and therefore is generally longer
  than the duration of the actual portfolio of individual bonds that make up the
  fund. References to duration in this commentary are intended to indicate fund
  duration unless otherwise noted.

Despite the increased volatility in the fixed-income markets during the summer
of 2003, the Funds' share prices and NAVs finished the period higher than they
had been at the beginning. As of October 31, 2003, the discounts to common share
NAV for all six Funds were narrower than they had been 12 months earlier.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED
OCTOBER 31, 2003?

Over this 12-month reporting period, we continued to place strong emphasis on
keeping the Funds fully invested and well diversified, improving call
protection, and enhancing dividend-paying capabilities. We also continued to
focus on managing the Funds'durations as a way of enhancing our ability to
mitigate interest rate risk and produce potentially more consistent returns over
time. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a Fund's portfolio will
decline when market interest rates rise (since bond prices move in the opposite
direction of interest rates). The longer the duration of a Fund's portfolio, the
greater its interest rate risk. As a result of our efforts, the durations of all
six Funds shortened over the 12 month reporting period.

In line with the steepness of the municipal yield curve, the majority of our
purchase activity over the past year focused on value opportunities in the
intermediate part of the yield curve (i.e., bonds that mature in 15 to 20
years). In many cases, bonds in this part of the curve offered yields similar to
those of longer-term bonds but, in our opinion, had less inherent interest rate
risk. In the recent market environment, we have also focused on bonds offering
above-market coupons that can help support the Funds' dividends and on issues in
the low AA/high A credit quality sectors that can add diversification.

<PAGE>

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
OCTOBER 31, 2003?

We believe that, given the current geopolitical and economic climate,
maintaining strong credit quality remains a vital requirement. As of October 31,
2003, these Nuveen Funds offered excellent credit quality, with allocations of
bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed and AA ranging from 65% to 83%.

Looking at bond calls, these Funds offer good levels of call protection over the
next two years, with potential call exposure ranging from 2% in NXZ and NZF to
11% in NPP during 2004 and 2005. The number of bond calls will depend largely on
market interest rates in coming months.

In general, we believe that these Nuveen Funds can continue to serve as
attractive sources of tax-free income, while simultaneously offering the
potential for portfolio diversification. In our opinion, the Funds represent a
quality component of a well- balanced core investment portfolio that can
continue to benefit shareholders over time.

Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 as of October

the financial highlights for the periods indicated therein. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted

to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of investments owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend

                         several Nuveen Funds owning various interests in the

                         behalf of the various Nuveen Funds. Cattaraugus
                         Acquisition Corp. has determined that a sale of the
                         facility is in the best interests of shareholders and
                         is proceeding accordingly.

                    ##   Non-income producing security. In June 2003, Waste
                         Solutions Group, Inc. (an entity formed for the benefit
                         of Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD) which

                         Resources Inc. assets on behalf of the Fund.
                         Bridgewater Resources Inc. emerged from bankruptcy in
                         June 2003. NAD, via Waste Solutions Group Inc., has
                         agreed to allow debt service reserve monies to be used
                         for capital expenses, and has also agreed to a debt
                         service moratorium until December 2005. Nuveen Advisory
                         Corp. will continue to actively monitor the Bridgewater
                         Resources, Inc. project, and to cause NAD and Waste
                         Solutions Group Inc. to act in what it believes is in
                         the best interests of fund shareholders.

                         variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a

                         currently in effect. This rate changes periodically

                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The National Funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding
Common share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund,
Inc. (NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. If it is
determined that market prices for a security are unavailable or inappropriate,
the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a
fair value for the security. Temporary investments in securities that have
variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2003,
there were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.

Professional Fees

Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations, audit fees, tax consulting fees
and, in some cases, workout expenditures. Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an investment, or to pursue other claims or
legal actions on behalf of the Fund's shareholders.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the
Funds. All monthly tax-exempt income dividends paid during the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2003, have been designated Exempt Interest Dividends.


                                       65

Notes to
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Offering Costs

Costs incurred by Performance Plus (NPP) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) in
connection with their offerings of Preferred shares ($502,535 and $3,493,773,
respectively) were recorded as a reduction to paid-in surplus.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Certain investments owned by the Funds are either covered by insurance issued by
several private insurers or are backed by an escrow or trust containing U.S.
Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both of which ensure the timely
payment of principal and interest in the event of default (62% for Performance
Plus (NPP), 55% for Municipal Advantage (NMA), 56% for Market Opportunity (NMO),
62% for Dividend Advantage (NAD), 53% for Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and 66% for
Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)). Such insurance or escrow, however, does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' shares.

For additional information regarding each investment security, refer to the
Portfolio of Investments of each Fund.

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.


NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A description of the policies and procedures that the Funds use to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (i) without
charge, upon request, by calling Nuveen Investments at (800) 257-8787; and (ii)
on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

POLICY CHANGE

On November 14, 2002, the Board adopted a policy that allows each Fund, in
addition to investments in municipal bonds, to invest up to 5% of its net assets
(including assets attributable to preferred shares, if any) in tax-exempt or
taxable fixed-income securities or equity securities for the purpose of
acquiring control of an issuer whose municipal bonds (a) the Fund already owns
and (b) have deteriorated or are expected shortly to deteriorate significantly
in credit quality, provided Nuveen Advisory determines that such investment
should enable the Fund to better maximize the value of its existing investment
in such issuer. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of each Fund which means
that it can be changed at any time by the Board of Trustees without vote of the
shareholders.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

Average Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's sensitivity to
changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's duration, the
more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates change.

Average Effective Maturity: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

Net Asset Value (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ---------

Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock,
where applicable, in the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed
advisable. No shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2003. Any future repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual
or semiannual report.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

financial expert is William E. Bennett, who is "independent" for purposes of
Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

In the rare event that a municipal issuer held by the Fund were to issue a proxy
or that the Fund were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security,
Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser") would either engage an independent third
party to determine how the proxy should be voted or vote the proxy with the
consent, or based on the instructions, of the Fund's Board of Directors or
Trustees or its representative. In the case of a conflict of interest, the proxy
would be submitted to the applicable Fund's Board to determine how the proxy
should be voted. A member of the Adviser's legal department would oversee the
administration of the voting, and ensure that records were maintained in
accordance with Rule 204-2(c)(2) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (17
CFR 275.204-2(c)(2)), reports were filed with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the
results were provided to the Board of Directors or Trustees and made available
to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's last
          fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case
