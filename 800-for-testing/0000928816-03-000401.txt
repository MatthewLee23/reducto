From the Trustees

[GRAPHIC OMITTED: PHOTO OF JOHN A. HILL AND GEORGE PUTNAM, III]

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

We are pleased to report that Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust closed
its fiscal year on April 30, 2003, showing a solid gain, though it came in
somewhat below its benchmark index and the average for its Lipper peer
group. Details are on page 8.

A number of factors combined to bolster the municipal-bond market during
the fiscal year's first half as safety-conscious investors continued to
seek refuge in the fixed-income markets. During the second half, however,
the environment became somewhat more volatile as investor interest faded in
the wake of a significant decline in tax revenues and subsequent downgrades
in credit quality. In the following report, your fund's managers provide a
discussion of how this situation affected the fund's performance and how
they view prospects in the months ahead.

As we look back on one of the most challenging periods in recent investment
history, we would like you to know how much we appreciate your continued
confidence in Putnam. We believe that those who ride out the current
turbulence will be rewarded for their patience over the long term.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III
Chairman of the Trustees      President of the Funds

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

* Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust's total return for the fiscal year
  ended April 30, 2003, was 7.35% at net asset value. Based on the market
  price of shares, the fund returned 7.35% for the period.

* Due to its higher exposure to certain industrial development bonds, the
  fund's returns lagged its benchmark, the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, which
  returned 8.50% for the period.

* For the same reason, the fund underperformed the average for its Lipper
  category, Closed-End General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged), which was
  10.27% for the period.

* Effective as of the March payment, the fund's monthly dividend was
  increased to $0.0795 per share. (See page 6 for details.)

* See the Performance Summary on page 8 for complete fund performance,
  comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

The overall decline in interest rates during the 12 months ended April 30,
2003, drove bond prices up and contributed to the fund's positive results.
The fund also benefited when some of its holdings were pre-refunded (see
page 5). However, higher-quality bonds were in greater demand during the
uncertain market environment of the past fiscal year. Because the fund
invests a portion of assets in lower-quality, higher-yielding municipal
bonds, it trailed the Lehman benchmark, which is composed entirely of
investment-grade securities.

Another factor that detracted from performance relative to its benchmark
and Lipper peer group was the fund's exposure to certain types of
industrial development bonds (IDBs). Although issued by municipalities,
IDBs are backed by the credit of private companies and their prices tend to
reflect perceptions of these companies and the industries in which they
operate. A relatively small position in airline-backed IDBs was affected by
the industry's struggles and detracted from competitive performance.


FUND PROFILE

The fund seeks to provide high current income free from federal income tax
consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing in
investment-grade and some below-investment-grade municipal bonds. The fund
may be appropriate for investors seeking tax-free income and who are
willing to accept a moderate degree of risk.


Market overview

The first half of the fiscal year was generally positive for the
municipal-bond market. In an environment marked by earnings
disappointments, economic weakness, and numerous allegations of corporate
malfeasance, investors sought the relative safety of high-quality bonds.
Increased demand for bonds pushed their prices higher, and some of your
fund's holdings benefited.

In the fiscal second half, however, several factors tempered municipal-bond
performance, including significant declines in tax revenues and subsequent
downgrades in municipalities' credit quality. Difficulties in two sectors
dampened the performance of industrial development bonds (IDBs), which are
issued by municipalities but backed by the credit of companies. Notably,
the fund's airline IDBs suffered as United Airlines followed US Airways
into bankruptcy. In late April, American Airlines narrowly avoided a
similar fate. The electric power sector was under pressure, affecting
performance of IDBs there as well. Lastly, over $320 billion in municipal
bonds was issued in 2002, an all-time record. The $12 billion California
Department of Water Resources' bond issue was the largest individual issue
ever brought to market. New tobacco settlement bonds further boosted
supply. (For a discussion of these bonds, see page 4). Supply has continued
to swell in 2003. These factors had a dampening effect on municipal-bond
prices. The municipal sector underperformed,  relative to Treasuries, in
the annual period.

Strategy overview

We positioned the portfolio more defensively in advance of the October
sell-off, but subsequently moved closer to a neutral stance by extending
the fund's duration. (Duration is a measure of sensitivity to interest-rate
changes. A fund with a longer duration is more sensitive to changes in
rates, whether up or down.)

During the period, falling interest rates prompted municipal-bond issuers
to refinance outstanding debt. As older, higher-yielding bonds were called
out of the market or matured, we sought new holdings that would provide the
most attractive income stream relative to the level of risk. At the same
time, we worked to increase the fund's diversification, by industry sector,
maturity, issuer, quality, and industry, as well as geographically. Some of
the changes resulting from our efforts include an increased position in New
York and California municipal bonds, which we feel offer excellent value at
present, and a reduced exposure to tobacco settlement bonds.

How key holdings and allocations affected performance

This fund's exposure to lower-quality, higher-yielding bonds put it at a
competitive disadvantage during the 12 months ended April 30, 2003, as
investors sought relative safety in high-quality issues. In particular, the
fund's performance was hurt by its exposure to industrial development bonds
(IDBs) backed by airline companies. Prices of IDBs are affected by investor
perception of the company backing the bonds. Troubles in the airline
industry have had negative repercussions on the municipal markets ever
since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when passenger counts
plummeted. The sluggish economy subsequently curtailed business travel,
while high jet-fuel prices increased costs. Finally, the war in Iraq and
(most recently) concern about SARS put up another barrier in the industry's
efforts to recover. Although airline IDBs accounted for a little over 2% of
your fund's assets as of the end of April, they have been the
worst-performing group in the portfolio.

The value of the fund's United Airlines IDBs fell sharply when United was
forced into bankruptcy in December. Although American Airlines has recently
avoided bankruptcy, the fund's holdings in this airline's IDBs have been
volatile in the past four months. In fact, the majority of the fund's IDBs
are backed by two of the nation's strongest carriers -- Northwest and Delta
- -- but they, too, succumbed to negative pressure affecting the entire
industry. Recently, however, we have been encouraged by the
labor/management negotiations that enabled American Airlines to stay in
business. Their success may show the way for a turnaround for the industry
as a whole once the economy recovers.

In the meantime, we have been diversifying the portfolio, taking advantage
of some of the wealth of new issues that have come to market. One example
was the California Department of Water Resources bonds -- the largest
single issue in municipal issuance history. We purchased two intermediate
bonds: $2 million of the uninsured bonds with a 6% coupon, maturing in
2015, rated A3 by Moody's and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's; and $2 million of
the insured bonds with a 5.5% coupon, maturing in 2016. The latter are
rated Aaa because of their insurance feature. These new positions satisfy
several of our current selection criteria -- expanding diversification by
issuer, quality, and maturity -- and they have performed well to date.

Tobacco settlement bonds are issued by municipalities and secured by the
settlement from class-action lawsuits against the tobacco industry. The
fund has had what we regard as a modest exposure to these bonds, reflecting
our concern that their income stream could be disrupted by financial
weakness in the tobacco companies providing the settlement money. We
decided against purchasing any of the recently-issued Golden State bonds
issued by the state of California and in February we sold some Wisconsin
tobacco settlement bonds to further reduce the fund's exposure to this
sector. We felt there were enough other, attractive municipal offerings on
the horizon. The recent price weakness in tobacco settlement bonds has
reinforced the prudence of our decisions.

The pre-refunding of two bond holdings contributed positively to fund
performance. When a bond is pre-refunded, a new bond is issued to decrease
the outstanding debt, with the proceeds typically invested in U.S. Treasury
securities, enhancing credit quality. Investors continue to receive
interest at the original coupon rate, typically until the next call date,
which makes the bond's effective maturity that much shorter. In December,
one of the fund's largest holdings, District of Columbia General
Obligations bonds (GOs), with a coupon of 6% and rated Baa1/BBB+, was
pre-refunded and the bonds increased in value to reflect their improved
credit quality due to collateralization in U.S. government securities and
shorter maturity. (GOs are backed by the taxes levied by the issuing
municipality.) Another fund holding, Jefferson County Alabama Sewer
Authority bonds, with a coupon of 5.75%, was also pre-refunded. However,
since these bonds were already high quality by virtue of a bond insurance
policy, the positive impact on the bonds' market price was a bit less.

Three recent purchases are also noteworthy because they are non-callable,
insured bonds that broadened the fund's diversification by state, coupon,
quality, and industry. Non-callable bonds offer investors opportunities for
interest payments that cannot be interrupted by redemption before the
maturity date. We recently purchased $4 million of the Delaware Valley
Regional Finance Authority bonds with a 5.5% coupon due in 2028; $3 million
of Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, Illinois bonds with a coupon
of 7% due in 2026; and $2 million of Georgia Local Governments COPs with a
coupon of 4.75% maturing in 2028. All three of the issues we purchased are
both insured and non-callable.

OF SPECIAL INTEREST

As interest on the fund's bonds accrue during the year we try to set level
payments that approximate income -- both actual and projected -- to provide
shareholders with a relatively stable income stream. Based on our most
recent projections, the fund's dividend was raised to $0.0795 per share in
March. Please bear in mind that future dividends cannot be assured.

The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

Our current outlook for the municipal-bond market is cautiously optimistic.
Fear of war has subsided. The focus is now on rebuilding Iraq and
addressing economic concerns on the home front. While much remains to be
answered, the level of uncertainty in the world seems to have eased. We
expect business activity to accelerate slowly and with continued
volatility. Although the tax-free marketplace is certainly not immune to
the forces that buffet other markets, it has historically been less
volatile. We believe municipal bonds should perform well relative to other
fixed-income sectors as some measure of calm returns to financial markets.

We believe that municipal budgets will continue to face meaningful
pressures in the months ahead. Historically, improvement in the credit
quality of state and local governments has lagged a general economic
recovery by six to nine months, so we expect municipal credit quality to
remain fragile for some time to come. Currently, municipal-bond yields
remain high relative to yields on taxable issues. In time, we expect that
relationship to revert to a normal range. In our opinion, the market
continues to offer attractive value and compelling risk/reward
characteristics and we have positioned your fund to seek to take advantage
of the market's potential.

Management. They are not meant as investment advice.

A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,  preceded
by the Report of independent accountants, constitute the fund's financial
statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values as
of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by asset
type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of concentration
and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to determine
the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately for each
class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount subtracted
from total assets includes the net assets allocated to remarketed preferred
shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss. This
is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from dividends and
interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses to determine net
investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss the fund realized
on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any unrealized gains or losses
over the period -- is added to or subtracted from the net investment result
to determine the fund's net gain or loss for the fiscal year.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number of
the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net investment
income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting period and the
most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed here may not match
the sources listed in the Statement of operations because the distributions
are determined on a tax basis and may be paid in a different period from
the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment results,
per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment income ratios, and
portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting the five most recent
reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the highlight table also
includes the current reporting period. For open-end funds, a separate table
is provided for each share class.



Report of independent accountants

To the Trustees and Shareholders of
Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the fund's portfolio, (except for bond ratings), and the related
statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund") at April 30, 2003, and
the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the
financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to
as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the fund's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments owned at April 30, 2003 by correspondence with
the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

(RAT) The Moody's or Standard & Poor's ratings indicated are believed to be
      the most recent ratings available at April 30, 2003 for the securities
      listed. Ratings are generally ascribed to securities at the time of
      issuance. While the agencies may from time to time revise such ratings,

Notes to financial statements

April 30, 2003

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment objective
is to seek a high level of current income exempt from federal income tax
and consistent with the preservation of capital. The fund intends to
achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of investment grade
municipal bonds that Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Putnam, LLC, believes to be  consistent with preservation of capital.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements is in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued on the basis of
valuations provided by an independent pricing service, approved by the
Trustees. Such services use information with respect to transactions in
bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable
securities and various relationships between securities in determining
value. Restricted securities are valued at fair value following procedures
approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and procedures are reviewed
periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell
is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on the
identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in excess
of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date; thereafter, any
remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on securities
it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures and
options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the hedged
instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the value of the
underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for the
contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is unable to perform.
When the contract is closed, the fund records a realized gain or loss equal
to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was
opened and the value at the time it was closed. Realized gains and losses
on purchased options are included in realized gains and losses on
investment securities.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the
value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as
"variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last sale
price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for purchased
options and the last ask price for written options. Options traded
over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers. Futures and
written option contracts outstanding at period end are listed after The
fund's portfolio.

D) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies.
It is also the intention of the fund to distribute an amount sufficient to
avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section 4982 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Therefore, no provision has been made for
federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized appreciation on
securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital gains.

At April 30, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of approximately
$14,831,000 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future
capital gains, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates
are:

 Loss Carryover   Expiration
- --------------------------------
     $4,581,000   April 30, 2004
        126,000   April 30, 2007
      2,789,000   April 30, 2008
      1,503,000   April 30, 2009
      2,244,000   April 30, 2010
      3,588,000   April 30, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending April 30, 2004 $2,849,439 of losses  recognized during the period
November 1, 2002 to April 30, 2003.

F) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on
the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on remarketed
preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by the Trustees.
Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares is generally a
28-day period for Series A and a 7-day period for Series B and Series C.
The applicable dividend rate for the remarketed preferred shares on April
30, 2003 was Series A 1.00%, Series B 1.25%, and Series C 1.25%. The amount
and  character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These differences include temporary and
permanent differences of losses on wash sales transactions, post October
loss deferrals, the expiration of capital loss carryover, dividends
payable, realized gains and losses on certain futures contracts, market
discount, and straddle loss deferrals. Reclassifications are made to the
fund's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution (or available capital loss carryovers) under income tax
regulations. For the year ended April 30, 2003, the fund reclassified
$28,376 to decrease undistributed net investment income and $2,044,912 to
decrease paid-in-capital, with a decrease to accumulated net realized
losses of $2,073,288.

The tax basis components of distributable earnings and the federal tax cost
as of period end were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation               $19,602,524
Unrealized depreciation               (16,743,731)
                                     ------------
Net unrealized appreciation             2,858,793
Undistributed tax exempt income         3,061,967
Undistributed ordinary income                 389
Capital loss carryforward             (14,831,099)
Post October loss                      (2,849,439)
Cost for federal income
tax purposes                         $323,049,107

G) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares is
determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative services and other transactions

Compensation of Putnam Management, for management and investment advisory
services is paid quarterly based on the average weekly net assets of the
fund. On January 1, 2003, fees payable to Putnam Management under the
fund's management contracts were changed to 0.65% of the fund's weekly
average net assets.

Prior to January 1, 2003, these fees were equal to the following annual
rates: 0.70% of the first $500 million of the average net asset value of
the fund, 0.60% of the next $500 million, 0.55% of the next $500 million
and 0.5 0% thereafter.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to the
proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then the
fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by the
amount of the excess (but not more than 0.65% of the liquidation preference
of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and their
staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The aggregate amount
of all such reimbursements is determined annually by the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam Fiduciary
Trust Company (PFTC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Investor
servicing agent functions are provided by Putnam Investor Services, a
division of PFTC.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits realized
as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of the
fund's expenses. For the year ended April 30, 2003, the fund's expenses
were reduced by $17,694 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $701 has been  allocated to the fund, and an additional fee for each
Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive additional fees for attendance
at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with the
Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have served
as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension Plan are
equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and meeting fees for
the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense for the fund is
included in Compensation of Trustees in the Statement of operations.
Accrued pension liability is included in Payable for compensation of
Trustees in the Statement of assets and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the year ended April 30, 2003, cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of investment securities other than short-term investments aggregated
$42,715,913 and $39,438,068, respectively. There were no purchases and
sales of U.S. government obligations.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A, B and C shares are redeemable at the option of the fund on
any dividend payment date at a redemption price of $50,000, $25,000 and
$25,000, respectively per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends
accumulated on a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption date
(whether or not such dividends have been declared) and, in certain
circumstances, a call premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income and capital
gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required to apportion
to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares throughout that year
additional dividends as necessary to result in an after-tax equivalent to
the applicable dividend rate for the period.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to maintain
asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed preferred
shares as of the last business day of each month in which any such shares
are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed preferred shares
and the shares' rating agencies. Should these requirements not be met, or
should dividends accrued on the remarketed preferred shares not be paid,
the fund may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain of the remarketed
preferred shares. At April 30, 2003, no such restrictions have been placed
on the fund.



Federal tax information
(Unaudited)

The fund has designated 99.97% of dividends paid from net investment income
during the fiscal year as tax exempt for Federal income tax purposes.

The Form 1099 you receive in January 2004 will show the tax status of all
distributions paid to your account in calendar 2003.
