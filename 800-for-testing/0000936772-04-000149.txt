Semi-Annual Report
This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the semi-annual reporting
period ended April 30, 2004.

Investment Objective and Policies
The Fund is a closed-end management investment company designed for investors
who seek high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. Under
normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80%, and normally
substantially all, of its assets in municipal securities paying interest that
is exempt from regular federal income tax. In addition, the Fund normally
invests at least 75% of its assets in investment grade municipal securities.

Investment Results
The following table provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended April 30, 2004. For comparison, returns for the Lipper General Municipal
Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average (the "Lipper Average") are also included. The
funds that comprise the Lipper Average have generally similar investment
objectives to the Fund, although some may have different investment policies
and sales and management fees.

a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment grade,
tax-exempt bond market. For the six- and 12-month periods ended April 30, 2004,
the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average consisted of 65 and
64 funds, respectively. These funds have generally similar investment
objectives to Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, although some may have
different investment policies and sales and management fees. An investor cannot
invest directly in an index or average, and their results are not indicative of
the performance for any specific investment, including Alliance National
Municipal Income Fund.

For the six-month period ended April 30, 2004, the municipal bond market posted
positive returns even though long municipal rates rose by 0.13%. During this
period, the Fund outperformed its benchmark, the LB Municipal Index. The Fund's
stronger relative performance was largely the result of certain holdings being
advance refunded as well as security selection in the insured and tobacco
settlement sectors. In addition, the Fund's leveraged structure benefited its
performance, primarily because of historically low borrowing costs. During the
six-month reporting period, the Fund also outperformed its peer group, as
represented by the Lipper Average.

Market Review and Investment Strategy
From October 31, 2003 to April 30, 2004, long-term municipal bond yields
increased by approximately 13 basis points. Over that time period, the long
municipal bond market slightly underperformed the taxable bond market on a
pre-tax basis, but outperformed on an after-tax basis. For example, the LB
Municipal Index gained 1.19% during the six-month period ended April 30, 2004
while the LB U.S. Aggregate Index, representing taxable bonds, generated a
pre-tax return of 1.25% over the same period. The Treasury bond component of
the aggregate index posted a lower pre-tax return of 0.75%. As of April 30,
2004, 30-year municipal bonds were yielding approximately 95% of comparable
maturity Treasury bonds.

Continued weak economic conditions, as well as minimal concern for inflation,
contributed to declining municipal bond yields through early March 2004. As
signs of economic recovery emerged in the latter part of March and into early
April, municipal bond yields started to rise in concert with taxable yields. In
anticipation of a more imminent reaction by the U.S. Federal Reserve to the
stronger economic indicators, the market began to push shorter maturity bond
yields higher at a faster pace than longer maturity bonds. As a result, the
difference between 30-year and five-year short-term municipal bond yields
declined by 0.43%. The yield curve, a plot of bond yields sorted by ascending
maturity, normally slopes upward for longer maturity bonds. When the difference
in yield between short- and long-term bonds declines, the change in the shape
of the curve is referred to as a "flattening." When the curve flattens, the
cost, as measured by the decline in yield, of reducing interest rate
sensitivity by moving from longer maturity bonds to shorter maturity bonds,
declines.


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND
<PAGE>


The prolonged low rate environment has resulted in an increased demand for
lower-rated bonds that carry higher yields. As demand for those higher yielding
bonds increased, the incremental difference in yield compared to better quality
bonds declined. As a result, higher yielding bonds, in general, generated
strong relative performance over the period.

Given their lower credit profiles, the health care and industrial development
sectors led the market in performance over the past six months. Two of the
weakest performing sectors, pre-refunded bonds and housing bonds, were high
credit quality sectors. Pre-refunded bonds typically have very short effective
maturities so rising short-term rates hurt the performance of those securities.
Continued concerns regarding increased refinancing activity limited price
improvement in municipal housing bonds. Municipal housing bonds are secured by
homeowners' mortgages. As homeowners prepay their mortgages, municipal housing
bonds are redeemed at par (100% of face value). Typically, lower yields cause
bond prices to increase, but if the market anticipates that a bond may be
redeemed in the near term, it is unlikely to value the bonds at a price much
above par.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2004 (unaudited)

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the Untied States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation
In accordance with Pricing Policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Fund (the "Pricing Policies") and applicable law, portfolio securities are
valued at current market value or at fair value. The Board of Directors has
delegated to Alliance Capital Management, L.P. (the "Adviser"), subject to the
Board's continuing oversight, certain responsibilities with respect to the
implementation of the Pricing Policies. Pursuant to the Pricing Policies,
securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at
their current market value. In general, the market value of these securities is
determined as follows:

Securities listed on a national securities exchange or on a foreign securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price at the close of the exchange or
foreign securities exchange. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such
day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is
valued in good faith at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.
Securities listed on more than one exchange are valued by reference to the
principal exchange on which the securities are traded; securities not listed on
an exchange but traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued
in accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call
options are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that
day, such securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open
futures contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement
price or, in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If
there are no quotations available for the day of valuations, the last available
closing settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter
market, (but excluding securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of
the current bid and asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau
or other comparable sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt
instruments having 60 days or less remaining until maturity are valued at
amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing
their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if their original term to
maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed
and asset backed securities, may be valued on the basis of prices


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 17
<PAGE>



provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one or more of the
major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are obtained, the
Pricing Policies provide that the Adviser may establish procedures whereby
changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a
recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other derivatives are
valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a major broker/dealer
in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at
fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies. The Fund fair values a
security that it holds when a significant event (e.g., an earthquake or a major
terrorist attack) occurs after the time that the latest market quotation was
established, and, as a result, such market quotation cannot be said to
represent the current market value of the security as of the time the Fund
prices its shares. Fair valuing securities is imprecise, and there is no
assurance that the Fund could dispose of the security at the price used for
determining the Fund's net asset value.

2. Taxes
It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions
Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions
Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. To the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are
reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily and paid monthly. The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion
of its


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND
<PAGE>


fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the Fund's
average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders for
the first 5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's average
daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in year 6,
0.15% in year 7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the six months ended
April 30, 2004, the amount of such fees waived was $643,319.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance Global
Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund
reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for the
Fund.During the six months ended April 30, 2004, there was no reimbursement
paid to AGIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions
Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the period ended April 30, 2004, were as follows:

                                             Purchases          Sales
                                         ---------------   ---------------
Investment securities (excluding
  U.S. government securities)            $    69,574,467   $    68,537,101
U.S. government securities                            -0-               -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was substantially the
same as the cost for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, gross
unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap
transactions) are as follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation                              $    15,541,678
Gross unrealized depreciation                                   (2,194,803)
                                                           ---------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                $    13,346,875
                                                           ===============

1. Swap Agreements
The Fund may enter into swaps to protect itself from interest rate fluctuations
on the underlying debt instruments and for investment purposes. A swap is an
agreement that obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at
specified intervals based upon or calculated by reference to changes in
specified prices or rates for a specified amount of an underlying asset. The
payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being
paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the
contract. Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each
counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.
Additionally, risks may arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or
in the value of the underlying securities.


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 19
<PAGE>


The Fund accrues for the interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis,
with the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of
swap contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities. Once the interim
payments are settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss
on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of
swaps contracts on the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the value of
swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

NOTE D
Common Stock
The Fund has 1,999,992,200 shares of $.001 par value common stock authorized.
There are 20,471,667 shares of common stock outstanding at April 30, 2004.

NOTE E
Preferred Stock
The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction
Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series T and W. The dividend rate on the Series M is 1.06% effective
through May 3, 2004. The dividend rate on the Series T is 1.45% effective
through March 8, 2004. The dividend rate on the Series W is 1.079% effective
through May 5, 2004. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 1.70% effective
through August 4, 2005.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

NOTE F
Distributions To Common Shareholders
The tax character of distributions to be paid to common shareholders for the
year ending October 31, 2004 will be determined at the end of the current
fiscal year. The tax character of distributions paid to common shareholders
during the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 were as
follows:

                                               2003              2002
                                         ---------------   ---------------
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income                        $        56,946   $        26,652
  Tax exempt income                           17,845,503        11,365,824
                                         ---------------   ---------------
Total distributions paid                 $    17,902,449   $    11,392,476(a)
                                         ===============   ===============

As of October 31, 2003, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                            $     4,039,444
Accumulated capital and other losses                            (3,829,443)(b)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                          17,185,598
                                                           ---------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                       $    17,395,599
                                                           ---------------

(a) Total distributions paid differ from the statement of changes in net assets
applicable to common shareholders because for tax purposes dividends are
recognized when actually paid.

(b) On October 31, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of $
3,829,443, of which $1,199,398 expires in the year 2010 and $2,630,045 expires
in the year 2011. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed.

NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund
Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain
a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss thereunder to be
remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings
As has been previously reported in the press, the Staff of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry
identified as "market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain
other regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into
these practices within the industry and have requested that Alliance Capital
Management L.P. ("Alliance Capital"), the Fund's Adviser, provide information
to them. Alliance Capital has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate
with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the
Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by the market.
Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the market timing
and late trading practices that are the subject of the investigations mentioned
above or the lawsuits described below. Please see below for a description of
the agreements reached by Alliance Capital and the SEC and NYAG in connection
with the investigations mentioned above.

In addition, numerous lawsuits have been filed against Alliance Capital and
certain other defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on
or related to the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG
investigations referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a
party. Management of the Fund's Adviser believes that these private lawsuits
are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, Alliance Capital confirmed that it had reached terms with
the SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is subject to final,
definitive documentation. Among the key provisions of these agreements are the
following:

(i) Alliance Capital agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
"Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse
effects of market timing attributable to market timing relationships described
in the SEC Order. According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be
paid, in order of priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share
of losses suffered by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate
share of advisory fees paid by such fund during the period of such market
timing;

(ii) Alliance Capital agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some
of the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January
1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii) Alliance Capital agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that Alliance
Capital's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

(a) Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(b) Based on average shares outstanding.

(c) Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(d) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(e) These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect of
dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(f) Annualized.

4.   The Fund?s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing
     and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
     30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the Fund and have:

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Fund,
          including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
          within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
          Report is being prepared;

     b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the Fund?s disclosure controls and
          procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Report based on such
          evaluation; and

     c)   disclosed in this Report any change in the Fund?s internal control
          over financial reporting that occurred during the Fund?s most recent
          fiscal half-year [or second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
          report] that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
          materially affect, the Fund?s internal control over financial
          reporting; and

5.   The Fund?s other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the Fund?s
     auditors and the audit committee of the Fund?s board of directors:

     a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
          control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
          adversely affect the Fund?s ability to record, process, summarize,
          and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the Fund?s internal controls.
