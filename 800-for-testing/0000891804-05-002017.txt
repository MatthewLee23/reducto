Timothy R. Schwertfeger
  Chairman of the Board

      Chairman's
            Letter to Shareholders

      Once again, I am pleased to report that over the six-month period covered
      by this semiannual report your Fund continued to provide you with monthly
      tax-free income and an attractive total return. For more details about the
      management strategy and performance of your Fund, please see the Portfolio
      Manager's Comments and Performance Overview sections of this report.

      As I noted in my last letter to you, our conversations with financial
      advisers and investors suggest that many of you may be wondering whether
      longer-term interest rates will soon begin to rise substantially,
      mirroring the rise that has taken place over the past year in shorter-term
      rates. If longer-term rates do begin to rise significantly, some of you
      also may be wondering if that makes this a good time to adjust your
      holdings of fixed-income investments. We can't answer these questions for
      you - no one knows what the future will bring.

"In fact, a well-diversified portfolio may actually help to reduce your overall
investment risk."

      From our experience, we do know that a well-balanced portfolio, structured
      and carefully monitored with the help of a trusted investment
      professional, can be an important component in helping you achieve your
      long-term financial goals. In fact, a well-diversified portfolio may
      actually help to reduce your overall investment risk. That is one reason
      why we believe that a municipal bond investment like your Nuveen Fund can
      be an important building block in a comprehensive investment program
      designed to perform well in a variety of market conditions.

      As in past reports, I urge you to consider receiving future Fund reports
      and other Fund information by e-mail and the Internet. Not only will you
      be able to receive the information faster, but this also may help lower
      your Fund's expenses. Sign up is quick and easy - see the inside front
      cover of this report for instructions.

      Some of you may have heard that in April, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers
      Companies, Inc., which owned 79% of Nuveen Investments, Inc. (the parent
      of your Fund's investment adviser) completed a public offering of a
      substantial portion of its equity stake in Nuveen. At the same time, St.
      Paul Travelers also entered into agreements to sell the balance of its
      shares in Nuveen to us or to others at a future date.

      These transactions will have no impact on the investment objectives or
      management of your Fund. However, taken as a whole they are considered to
      be an "assignment" of your Fund's investment management agreement. This
      means that you and your fellow Fund shareholders soon will be asked to
      formally approve the continuation of your Fund's management contract with
      Nuveen. We will be sending you more information about this process in the
      coming weeks.

      At Nuveen Investments, our mission continues to be to assist you and your
      financial advisor by offering investment services and products that can
      help you to secure your financial objectives. We are grateful that you
      have chosen us as a partner as you pursue your financial goals, and we
      look forward to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years
      ahead.

      Sincerely,


      /s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds
NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, NXZ, NZF

Portfolio Manager's
         Comments

Portfolio manager Tom Spalding reviews key investment strategies and the
semiannual performance of these six Funds. With 30 years of investment
experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ since its inception in 2001 and NPP,
NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF since 2003.

What key strategies were used to manage these Funds during the six months ended
April 30, 2005?

Between November 2004 and April 2005, the Federal Reserve introduced four
quarter-point increases in the fed funds rate, raising this short-term rate
benchmark from 1.75% to 2.75%. (On May 3, 2005, following the end of this
reporting period, the Fed announced another 0.25% hike, bringing the fed funds
rate to 3.00%.) Given these short-term rate increases, many market participants
expected to see steadily higher interest rates across most of the municipal
market yield curve as we moved through the reporting period. This did not occur,
as longer-term yields (as measured by the widely-followed Bond Buyer 25 Revenue
Municipal Bond Index) declined by 14 basis points during the six-month period.
As a result, the municipal yield curve flattened.

In this environment, our focus for all these Funds remained on a strategy we
have employed for the past few years - finding and holding bonds that, in our
judgment, would add immediate value to the Funds' portfolios and that could also
perform well under a variety of future market scenarios.

As a result, our purchase activity during this period generally concentrated on
bonds in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve, that is, bonds that
mature in about 20 years. In our opinion, this part of the municipal market
yield curve often offered more attractive opportunities and better values than
bonds with longer or shorter maturities. The specific securities purchased for
each Fund varied according to the average maturity of the Fund's current
portfolio and its overall sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.

As discussed in our last shareholder report, in late 2004 we began using forward
interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, in an attempt to
reduce some of the interest rate risk in NXZ. It is important to note that we
did not use the hedge in an attempt to profit from correctly predicting the
timing and direction of interest rate movements. Instead, our sole objective was
to reduce NXZ's duration (and therefore its price sensitivity to interest rate
changes) without having a negative impact on its income stream or common share
dividends over the short term. The gain or loss from the hedge is reflected as
an addition or subtraction to the Fund's net asset value (NAV) as the


4
<PAGE>

market value of the hedge fluctuates. The hedge, was effective in helping to
reduce the NAV volatility of NXZ over the course of this reporting period.
However, it had a negative impact on the Fund's total return over the six-month
period because declining long-term interest rates caused the value of the hedge
to decline as the value of the Fund's portfolio rose.

How did the Funds perform?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as for a comparative index and
average, are presented in the accompanying table.

*     Six-month returns are cumulative; returns for one year, five years, and
      ten years are annualized.

Past performance is not predictive of future results. Current performance may be
higher or lower than the data shown. Returns do not reflect the deduction of
taxes that shareholders may have to pay on Fund distributions or upon the sale
of Fund shares.

For additional information, see the individual Performance Overview for your
Fund in this report.

For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the cumulative returns on NAV for all
six of the Funds covered in this report outperformed the return on the Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index. NXZ and NZF also outperformed the average return
for their Lipper peer group, while NPP, NMA, NMO and NAD trailed this measure.

One of the primary factors benefiting the six-month performance of these Funds
relative to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers index was the Funds' use of
financial leverage. While leveraging can add volatility to the Funds' NAVs and
share prices, especially during periods of rising interest rates, this strategy
can also provide opportunities for additional income and total returns for
common shareholders when short-term interest rates remain relatively low and
long-term rates fall or remain fairly constant, as they did during this
reporting period.

(1)   The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged
      national index comprising a broad range of investment-grade municipal
      bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

(2)   The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds category average is
      calculated using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in
      this category for each period as follows: 6 months, 67 funds; 1 year, 67
      funds; 5 years, 51 funds; and 10 years, 46 funds. Fund and Lipper returns
      assume reinvestment of dividends.


                                                                               5
<PAGE>

As noted earlier, the municipal market yield curve flattened over the course of
the reporting period. As a result, the prices of bonds with longer maturities
generally tended to perform better than those of securities with shorter
maturities. This contributed to the relatively strong performance of NXZ and
NZF, which had more exposure to the longer end of the yield curve than the other
four Funds. Each Fund's specific holdings of longer and shorter maturity bonds
accounted for much of the performance differentials between them over these
six-months.

The flattening of the yield curve during this period also created an environment
in which many issuers found refunding existing issues to be economically
attractive. This led to an increase in escrowed and pre-refunded holdings in
most of the Funds, especially NPP, NMA, NXZ and NZF. The performance of the
Funds was boosted by these advance refundings, which resulted in price
appreciation as well as enhanced credit quality. At the same time, we were
trimming the Funds' holdings of some older pre-refunded bonds, which tended to
underperform the general municipal market during this period due primarily to
the shorter effective maturities of these bonds.

All of the Funds also benefited from their allocations of lower quality bonds
during this period, with bonds rated BBB generally outperforming other credit
quality sectors as the demand for these bonds increased. Among the lower-rated
holdings making positive contributions to the Funds' cumulative six-month
returns were hospital bonds, as the healthcare sector ranked second in terms of
performance among the Lehman municipal revenue sectors for the period. In
addition, bonds backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement agreement also
produced solid performance during this period, as the litigation environment
improved and increased demand drove tobacco bond prices higher. As of April 30,
2005, all of these Funds held close to 5% of their portfolio assets in tobacco
bonds.

Also during this reporting period, NMO continued to hold bonds issued by the
Indianapolis Airport Authority and originally backed by United Airlines. As the
airline continued its struggle to emerge from bankruptcy, these bonds continued
to decline in value, which detracted from NMO's performance during this period.
NXZ and NZF also held small quantities of these bonds.

<PAGE>

How were the Funds positioned in terms of credit quality and bond calls as of
April 30, 2005?

Even though lower quality bonds performed well over this period, we continued to
believe that in the current geopolitical and economic climate it was important
to maintain strong credit quality. As of April 30, 2005, all six of these Funds
continued to offer excellent credit quality, with allocations of bonds rated
AAA/U.S. guaranteed and AA ranging from 66% in NXZ to 76% in NMA, 78% in NAD,
80% in NMO, 82% in NZF and 83% in NPP.

At the end of April 2005, potential call exposure for the period May 2005
through the end of 2006 ranged from 4% in NXZ to 5% in NZF, 7% in NMO, 11% in
NAD, and 13% in NPP and NMA. The number of actual bond calls in all of these
Funds depends largely on future market interest rates.


                                                                               7

Dividend and Share Price
      Information

All six of the Funds in this report use leverage to enhance opportunities for
additional income for common shareholders. The extent of this benefit is tied in
part to the short-term rates the Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders.
During periods of low short-term rates, leveraged Funds generally pay lower
dividends to MuniPreferred shareholders, which can leave more earnings to
support common share dividends. However, when short-term interest rates rise, as
they did during this reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs also rise.
While leveraging can still provide benefits for common shareholders as
short-term rates rise, the extent of the benefit may be less. In addition, any
reinvested proceeds from bonds called or retired during this period were
reinvested in a low interest rate environment, which also tended to reduce the
income generated by the Funds. The combination of these two factors led to
dividend reductions in NPP, NMA, NMO and NAD over the six-month period ended
April 30, 2005. The dividends of NXZ and NZF, which experienced fewer bond
calls, remained stable during this period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of the following Funds received capital gains and/or net ordinary income
distributions at the end of December 2004 as follows:

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's net asset value (NAV). Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively
paid dividends in excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII
that is likewise reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all
of its net investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2005,
all of the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances for both financial
statement and tax purposes.

At the end of the reporting period, the Funds' share prices were trading at
discounts to their NAVs as shown in the accompanying table:

(1)   Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. For
      investments that generate qualified dividend income, the
      taxable-equivalent yield is lower.

              #   On December 9, 2002, UAL  Corporation,  the holding company of
                  United  Air  Lines,   Inc.,   filed  for  federal   bankruptcy
                  protection.  The Adviser  determined that it was likely United
                  would not remain current on their interest payment obligations
                  with  respect  to these  bonds and thus has  stopped  accruing
                  interest.

           (WI)   Security purchased on a when-issued basis.

            (a)   The issuer has received a  preliminary  adverse  determination
                  from the Internal  Revenue  Service (the "IRS")  regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon  payments as tax-exempt  income until
                  such time that it is formally  determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

                  otherwise noted.

              *   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices
                  of the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be
                  other call provisions at varying prices at later dates.

             **   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
                  rating.

            ***   Securities are backed by an escrow or trust containing
                  sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
                  securities which ensures the timely payment of principal and
                  interest. Such securities are normally considered to be
                  equivalent to AAA rated securities.

              #   On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation, the holding company of
                  United Air Lines, Inc., filed for federal bankruptcy
                  protection. The Adviser determined that it was likely United
                  would not remain current on their interest payment obligations
                  with respect to these bonds and thus has stopped accruing
                  interest.

            N/R   Investment is not rated.

           (WI)   Security purchased on a when-issued basis.

            (a)   The issuer has received a preliminary adverse determination
                  from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon payments as tax-exempt income until
                  such time that it is formally determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

              #   Non-income producing security. In June 2003, Waste Solutions
                  Group, Inc. (an entity formed for the benefit of Nuveen
                  Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD) which owns various
                  interests in the Bridgewater Resources Inc. project) took
                  possession of 45% of the Bridgewater Resources Inc. assets on
                  behalf of the Fund. Bridgewater Resources Inc. emerged from
                  bankruptcy in June 2003. NAD, via Waste Solutions Group Inc.,
                  has agreed to allow debt service reserve monies to be used for
                  capital expenses, and has also agreed to a debt service
                  moratorium until December 2005. Nuveen Asset Management will
                  continue to actively monitor the Bridgewater Resources, Inc.
                  project, and to cause NAD and Waste Solutions Group Inc. to
                  act in what it believes is in the best interests of fund
                  shareholders.

           (WI)   Security purchased on a when-issued basis.

            (a)   The issuer has received a preliminary adverse determination
                  from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon payments as tax-exempt income until
                  such time that it is formally determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

            (1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                  based on net assets applicable to Common shares unless
                  otherwise noted.

            (2)   Effective date represents the date on which both the Fund and
                  counterparty commence interest payment accruals on each
                  forward swap contract.

              *   Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices of
                  the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other
                  call provisions at varying prices at later dates.

             **   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
                  rating.

            ***   Securities are backed by an escrow or trust containing
                  sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
                  securities which ensures the timely payment of principal and
                  interest. Such securities are normally considered to be
                  equivalent to AAA rated securities.

            N/R   Investment is not rated.

              #   On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation, the holding company of
                  United Air Lines, Inc., filed for federal bankruptcy
                  protection. The Adviser determined that it was likely United
                  would not remain current on their interest payment obligations
                  with respect to these bonds and thus has stopped accruing
                  interest.

          (PLG)   Portion of security, with an aggregate market value of
                  $421,775, has been pledged to collateralize the net payment
                  obligations under forward swap contracts.

            (a)   The issuer has received a preliminary adverse determination
                  from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon payments as tax-exempt income until
                  such time that it is formally determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

                  securities  which ensures the timely  payment of principal and
                  interest.  Such  securities  are  normally  considered  to  be

              #   On December 9, 2002, UAL  Corporation,  the holding company of
                  United  Air  Lines,   Inc.,   filed  for  federal   bankruptcy
                  protection.  The Adviser  determined that it was likely United
                  would not remain current on their interest payment obligations
                  with  respect  to these  bonds and thus has  stopped  accruing
                  interest.

           (WI)   Security purchased on a when-issued basis.

              +   Security  has a  maturity  of  more  than  one  year,  but has
                  variable  rate  and  demand  features  which  qualify  it as a
                  short-term  security.  The rate disclosed is that in effect at
                  the  end  of  the   reporting   period.   This  rate   changes
                  periodically  based on market conditions or a specified market
                  index.

            (a)   The issuer has received a  preliminary  adverse  determination
                  from the Internal  Revenue  Service (the "IRS")  regarding the
                  tax-exempt status of the bonds' coupon payments. The Fund will
                  continue to treat coupon  payments as tax-exempt  income until
                  such time that it is formally  determined that the interest on
                  the bonds should be treated as taxable.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds")  covered in this report and their  corresponding  Common
share stock exchange  symbols are Nuveen  Performance  Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NPP),  Nuveen  Municipal  Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA),  Nuveen  Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO),  Nuveen Dividend  Advantage  Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend  Advantage  Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal  Fund 3 (NZF).  Performance  Plus (NPP),  Municipal  Advantage  (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend  Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend  Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock  Exchange.  The Funds are registered  under the
Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended,  as  closed-end,   diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing  primarily  in a  diversified  portfolio  of municipal  obligations
issued by state and local government authorities.

Effective  January 1, 2005, Nuveen Advisory Corp.  ("NAC"),  the Funds' previous
Adviser, and its affiliate,  Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp. ("NIAC"),  were
merged into Nuveen Asset Management  ("NAM"),  each wholly owned subsidiaries of
Nuveen Investments,  Inc. ("Nuveen").  As a result of the merger, NAM is now the
Adviser to all funds previously advised by either NAC or NIAC.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their  financial  statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's  investment  portfolio are provided
by a pricing service  approved by the Fund's Board of  Directors/Trustees.  When
price quotes are not readily  available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities),  the pricing service  establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of  municipal  bonds of  comparable  quality,  type of issue,  coupon,
maturity and rating,  indications of value from securities dealers,  evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. Prices of
derivative  investments  are also  provided by an  independent  pricing  service
approved by each Fund's Board of  Directors/Trustees.  If the pricing service is
unable to supply a price for a derivative  investment each Fund may use a market
quote provided by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined
that market prices for an investment are unavailable or inappropriate, the Board
of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,  may establish a fair value
for the investment.  Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate
and demand  features  qualifying  them as  short-term  securities  are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities  transactions are recorded on a trade date basis.  Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific  identification  method.
Securities  purchased  on a  when-issued  or  delayed  delivery  basis  may have
extended settlement  periods.  Any securities so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation  during this  period.  The Funds have  instructed  the  custodian to
segregate  assets  with a  current  value at least  equal to the  amount  of the
when-issued  and  delayed  delivery  purchase  commitments.  At April 30,  2005,
Performance Plus (NPP),  Municipal  Advantage (NMA),  Market  Opportunity (NMO),
Dividend  Advantage  (NAD)  and  Dividend  Advantage  3  (NZF)  had  outstanding
when-issued   purchase  commitments  of  $2,034,620,   $1,882,831,   $4,592,870,
$1,988,803 and $2,848,468, respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase
commitments in Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ).

Investment Income

Interest  income,  which includes the  amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial  reporting  purposes,  is recorded on an accrual  basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Professional Fees

Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations,  audit fees,  tax  consulting  fees
and, in some cases, workout  expenditures.  Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an  investment,  or to pursue  other  claims or
legal actions on behalf of the Fund's shareholders.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate  taxpayer  for federal  income tax  purposes.  Each Fund
intends to distribute  substantially  all net investment  income and net capital
gains  to  shareholders  and  to  otherwise  comply  with  the  requirements  of
Subchapter M of the Internal  Revenue Code  applicable  to regulated  investment
companies.  Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund  intends  to  satisfy  conditions  which  will  enable  interest  from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain
such  tax-exempt  status when  distributed  to  shareholders  of the Funds.  Net
realized capital gains and ordinary income  distributions  paid by the Funds are
subject to federal taxation.


                                                                              67

      Notes to
            Financial Statements (Unaudited) (continued)

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends  from  tax-exempt  net  investment  income are declared  monthly.  Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment  transactions,  if
any,  are  distributed  to  shareholders  not  less  frequently  than  annually.
Furthermore,  capital  gains are  distributed  only to the  extent  they  exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common  shareholders of tax-exempt net investment  income,  net
realized  capital  gains  and/or  market  discount,  if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend  date.  The amount and timing of  distributions  are  determined  in
accordance  with  federal  income tax  regulations,  which may differ  from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage.  Each Fund's Preferred shares
are  issued  in more  than one  Series.  The  dividend  rate on each  Series  is
determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the
auction agent, and is payable weekly at the end of each rate period.  The number
of Preferred  shares  outstanding,  by Series and in total,  for each Fund is as
follows:

Forward Swap Transactions

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments. The Funds' use
of forward interest rate swap  transactions is intended to mitigate the negative
impact that an increase in long-term  interest  rates could have on Common share
net asset value.  Forward  interest rate swap  transactions  involve each Fund's
agreement with the  counterparty to pay, in the future,  a fixed rate payment in
exchange  for the  counterparty  paying the Fund a variable  rate  payment.  The
amount of the payment  obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward
swap contract. The Funds may close out a contract prior to the effective date at
which point a realized gain or loss would be recognized.  When a forward swap is
terminated,  it does not involve the delivery of securities or other  underlying
assets or principal,  but rather is settled in cash.  Each Fund intends,  but is
not  obligated  to,  terminate  its forward  swaps  before the  effective  date.
Accordingly,  the risk of loss with  respect  to the swap  counterparty  on such
transactions  is limited  to the  credit  risk  associated  with a  counterparty
failing  to honor  its  commitment  to pay any  realized  gain to the Fund  upon
termination.  To minimize such credit risk, all  counterparties  are required to
pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of
each Fund with a value  approximately equal to the amount of any unrealized gain
above a pre-determined  threshold.  Reciprocally,  when any of the Funds have an
unrealized  loss on a swap contract,  the Funds have instructed the custodian to
pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately equal to the
amount of the  unrealized  loss  above a  pre-determined  threshold.  Collateral
pledges are monitored and subsequently  adjusted if and when the swap valuations
fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the pre-determined threshold amount.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement  with the custodian bank whereby certain  custodian
fees and expenses  are reduced by credits  earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the  bank.  Such  deposit  arrangements  are an  alternative  to  overnight
investments.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds'  organizational  documents,  its Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified  against certain  liabilities  arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds.  In addition,  in the normal course of business,  the
Funds  enter into  contracts  that  provide  general  indemnifications  to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred.  However,  the Funds have not had prior  claims or losses  pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities at the
date of the  financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of  increases  and
decreases in net assets  applicable to Common shares from operations  during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

As  approved by the Board of  Directors/Trustees,  effective  August 1, 2004,  a
complex-wide management fee structure was adopted for all funds sponsored by the
Adviser,  or its predecessor and its  affiliates.  This fee structure  separates
each fund's  management  fee into two  components - a  complex-level  component,
based on the aggregate  amount of all fund assets managed by the Adviser,  and a
specific  fund-level  component,  based only on the amount of assets within each
individual  fund.  This pricing  structure  enables Nuveen fund  shareholders to
benefit from growth in the assets  within each  individual  fund as well as from
growth in the amount of  complex-wide  assets  managed by the Adviser.  Under no
circumstances  will this pricing  structure  result in a fund paying  management
fees  at a rate  higher  than  would  otherwise  have  been  applicable  had the
complex-wide management fee structure not been implemented.  As of May 31, 2005,
the complex-level fee rate was .1905%; that is, the funds' effective  management
fees were reduced by approximately .0095%.

Effective August 1, 2004, the annual  fund-level fee, payable monthly,  for each
of the Funds is based upon the average  daily net assets  (including  net assets
attributable to Preferred shares) of each Fund as follows:

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
      the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
      all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
      in the U.S.

(2)   With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
      rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
      date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
      billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
      be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
      fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
      time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall  investment  advisory and
administrative  services  and  general  office  facilities.  The  Funds  pay  no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to their  officers,  all of whom receive  remuneration  for their
services  to the  Funds  from  the  Adviser  or its  affiliates.  The  Board  of
Directors/Trustees  has  adopted a deferred  compensation  plan for  independent
Directors/Trustees that enables  Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual  compensation  they are  entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised Funds.  Under the plan,  deferred  amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
Funds.

6. ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING PARENT COMPANY OF ADVISER

In early  April,  2005,  The St.  Paul  Travelers  Companies,  Inc.  ("St.  Paul
Travelers"),  which owned 79% of Nuveen,  (A)  completed a public  offering of a
substantial  portion of its equity stake in Nuveen, (B) sold Nuveen $200 million
of its Nuveen  shares,  (C)  entered  into an  agreement  with Nuveen to sell an
additional  $400 million of its Nuveen shares on a "forward"  basis with payment
for and settlement of these shares delayed for several  months,  and (D) entered
into agreements with two unaffiliated investment banking firms to sell an amount
equal to most or all of its remaining  Nuveen shares for current payment but for
future settlement. The settlement of transactions (C) and (D) above would likely
be  deemed  an  "assignment"  (as  defined  in the 1940  Act) of the  investment
management  agreements between the Funds and the Adviser,  which would result in
the automatic  termination  of each  agreement  under the 1940 Act. The Board of
Directors/Trustees  will consider approval of new ongoing investment  management
agreements for each Fund and the submission of those  agreements for approval by
each respective Fund's shareholders.  Those agreements,  if approved by a Fund's
shareholders,  would take effect upon such  approval.  There can be no assurance
that these approvals will be obtained.


                                                                              73

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over
which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a
measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when
market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration,
the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.
Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund
and therefore is longer than the duration of the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.
