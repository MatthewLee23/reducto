CHAIRMAN'S LETTER


Dear Fellow Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report of the Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund, for the period ending October 31, 2003. The
report includes a listing of the Fund's investments and its financial statements
for the reporting period.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide high current income, and its
secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation. In seeking to accomplish
both, we are assembling a portfolio with a broad mix of equity securities of
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks out real estate securities that are
attractively priced relative to their historical growth rates and the valuation
of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investing philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to keep earning it.

Sincerely,

/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. Portfolio Commentary

We are pleased to present our first report to shareholders of the Neuberger
Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX: NRO), which opened on
October 28, 2003. At the close of this reporting period, on October 31, 2003,
the Fund was not fully invested, but we are optimistic about the opportunities
we see in the real estate marketplace and particularly in Real Estate Investment
Trusts (REITs).

We believe the U.S. economy is in the early stages of a recovery that will
extend through 2004 and into 2005. Consumer spending, which has supported the
economy over the last several years, remains strong. Capital spending appears to
be recovering as the capacity glut recedes. Perhaps most importantly, corporate
America is finally hiring again. More Americans going back to work has positive
implications for consumer confidence and consumer spending. It should also
revive demand in the office sector, fundamentally the weakest property category.
We doubt 2004 Gross Domestic Product Growth (GDP) growth will match the calendar
third quarter's impressive 8.2% growth rate, but we expect growth in the healthy
4% plus range.

We also expect commercial real estate fundamentals to improve significantly over
the next 12 months. Supply growth, as measured by new permits and construction
starts as a percentage of existing supply, is decelerating and we expect the
level of supply growth for most property sectors to be below long-term averages
for the next 12 to 18 months. Demand should improve substantially as the economy
expands. Increasing demand should translate into accelerating earnings growth
for REITs.

We believe hotel/lodging, apartment, and industrial REITs should be among the
first property sectors to benefit. The hotel/lodging sector appears particularly
attractive to us. Construction activity has been at historically low levels for
three years. The significant operating leverage resulting from recent years'
intense cost cutting could be magnified in earnings as the business traveler
takes to the road again and vacancy rates fall. We think the apartment sector
should rebound as rising mortgage rates price more people out of the new housing
market, and we expect industrial REITs (warehouses) to benefit as businesses
rebuild inventories after an extended inventory liquidation cycle.

Due to the resilience of the American consumer, the regional mall sector has
performed exceptionally well over the last three years. If consumer spending
remains at or near current levels, regional mall REIT earnings should continue
to grow nicely. Although valuations are not as attractive as other property
sectors, based on above-average earnings growth potential, we believe regional
mall REITs are still reasonably valued.

After REITs' exceptional absolute and relative performance in recent years,
valuations are in the

mid- to upper-end of historical ranges. While REITs no longer appear "cheap," we
think they are reasonably priced relative to asset values and improving earnings
prospects. We believe that even if the stock market continues to rally strongly
in the year ahead, REITs will retain a loyal following, in large part because
the increased institutional sponsorship of REITs makes a robust stock market
less of a competitive threat than it has been in the past.

Sincerely,

                                /s/ Steven Brown

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investment securities of the Fund are valued at the latest sales price
     where that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price on that day. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market
     are normally valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price
     ("NOCP") provided by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most
     recently reported price as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price
     is outside the range of the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid
     and asked prices that dealers quote to each other when trading for their
     own accounts); in that case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the
     inside bid or asked price, whichever is closer. Because of delays in
     reporting trades, the NOCP may not be based on the price of the last trade
     to occur before the market closes. The Fund values all other securities by
     a method the directors of Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income
     Fund Inc. believe accurately reflects fair value. Numerous factors may be
     considered when determining the fair value of a security, including
     available analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
     whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
     outstanding. Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until
     maturity may be valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned,
     approximates market value.
#    At cost, which approximates market value.
##   At October 31, 2003, the cost of investments for U.S. Federal income tax
     purposes and book purposes was $418,348,000.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

   NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1  GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
   "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
   non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund had no
   operations until October 31, 2003, other than matters relating to its
   organization and the sale on September 26, 2003 of 6,981 shares of common
   stock for $100,003 ($14.325 per share) to Neuberger Berman, LLC
   ("Neuberger"), the Fund's sub-adviser. The Board of Directors of the Fund may
   classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock into one or more
   classes of preferred stock without the approval of shareholders.

   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States requires Neuberger Berman
   Management Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date
   of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
   estimates.

2  PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
   notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
   recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
   ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
   recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest
   income, including accretion of original issue discount, where applicable, and
   accretion of discount on short-term investments, is recorded on the accrual
   basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on
   the basis of identified cost.

4  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the intention of the Fund to qualify as a
   regulated investment company by complying with the provisions available to
   certain investment companies, as defined in applicable sections of the
   Internal Revenue Code, and to make distributions of investment company
   taxable income and net capital gains (after reduction for any amounts
   available for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as capital loss carryforwards)
   sufficient to relieve it from all, or substantially all, U.S. Federal income
   taxes. Accordingly, the Fund paid no U.S. Federal income taxes and no
   provision for U.S. Federal income taxes was required.

5  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of
   expenses, daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare
   quarterly and pay dividends from net investment income on a monthly basis.
   Distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, are normally
   distributed in December. Income dividends and capital gain distributions to
   shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. To the extent the Fund's
   net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset by capital loss
   carryforwards, it is the policy of the Fund not to distribute such gains.

   The Fund distinguishes between dividends on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and
   profits are reported in the financial statements as a tax return of capital.
   Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
   financial statements and

                                       10

<Page>

   tax earnings and profits which result in temporary over-distributions for
   financial statement purposes are classified as distributions in excess of net
   investment income or accumulated net realized gains in the components of net
   assets on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

   As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
   losses) on a federal income tax basis were as follows:

<Table>

                                                           LOSS
                                    UNDISTRIBUTED        CARRY-
                                         ORDINARY      FORWARDS
                                           INCOME  AND DEFERRALS  TOTAL
                                              <S>            <C>    <C>
                                              $ -            $ -    $ -
</Table>

   The difference between book basis and tax basis is attributable primarily to
   net operating losses.

6  EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Some bills are applicable to multiple funds. Expenses
   directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund. Expenses not
   directly attributed to a Fund are allocated, on the basis of relative net
   assets, except where a more appropriate allocation of expenses can otherwise
   be made fairly.

7  ORGANIZATION EXPENSES AND OFFERING COSTS: Management has agreed to pay all
   organizational expenses and the amount by which the Fund's offering costs for
   common stock (other than sales load) exceed $0.03 per share. The costs
   incurred by Management were approximately $25,500. Offering costs for common
   stock to be paid by the Fund were charged as a reduction of paid-in-capital
   at the completion of the Fund's offering and amounted to $870,000.

8  CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The Fund may, for cash management purposes, during a
   reasonable start-up period following the initial offering, or for defensive
   purposes, temporarily hold all or a substantial portion of its assets in
   cash, high-quality, short-term money market instruments, or in high-quality
   debt securities. The ability of the issuers of the money market instruments
   and debt securities held by the Fund to meet their obligations may be
   affected by economic developments, including those particular to a specific
   industry or region.

   Following the start-up period, under normal market conditions, the Fund's
   investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
   securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and non-convertible
   debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority of their revenue
   from the ownership, construction, financing, management and/or sale of
   commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate. Values of the
   securities of such companies may fluctuate due to economic, legal, cultural,
   geopolitical or technological developments affecting the United States real
   estate industry.

   NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
   AFFILIATES:

   The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
   Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays Management
   a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed Assets.
   Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund less liabilities, other

                                       11

<Page>

   than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of leverage. For
   purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the liquidation value of any
   preferred shares outstanding is not considered a liability.

   Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management fees
   it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

<Table>

               FISCAL PERIOD OR YEAR ENDED              % OF AVERAGE

                        <S>                                 <C>
                        2003 - 2008                         0.25
                           2009                             0.19
                           2010                             0.13
                           2011                             0.07
</Table>

   Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October 31,
   2011.

   For the period ended October 31, 2003, such waived fees amounted to $2,840.

   The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
   Agreement ("Agreement"). Pursuant to this Agreement the Fund pays Management
   an administration fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily
   Managed Assets. Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust
   Company ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
   Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received under
   the agreement.

   On October 31, 2003, Management and Neuberger, a member firm of The New York
   Stock Exchange and sub-adviser to the Fund, became indirect wholly owned
   subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly held
   company (the "Transaction"). Upon completion of the Transaction, the Fund's
   management and sub-advisory agreements automatically terminated. To provide
   for continuity of management, the Board of Directors, which was aware of the
   impending Transaction when the Fund was established, and the initial sole
   shareholder of the Fund voted to approve new management and sub-advisory
   agreements to take effect upon closing of the Transaction. Neuberger is
   retained by Management to furnish it with investment recommendations and
   research information without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals who
   are officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of Neuberger
   and/or Management.

   The Fund entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it to pay
   some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the commissions it
   pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund. Expenses paid
   through this program may include costs of custodial, transfer agency or
   accounting services. There were no amounts recaptured for the one day period
   ended October 31, 2003.

   The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
   contract. The impact of this arrangement, reflected in the Statement of
   Operations under the caption Custodian fees, was a reduction of $54.

                                       12

   transactions (excluding short-term securities) of $2,915,500 and $0,
   respectively.

   transactions amounted to $8,500, of which Neuberger received $0, Lehman

</Table>

   NOTE E--USE OF LEVERAGE:

   Subject to market conditions, the Fund intends to offer Preferred Shares
   representing approximately 33% of the Fund's capital after issuance. The Fund
   also may add leverage to the portfolio through the utilization of derivative
   instruments. The Fund may issue Preferred Shares so long as after their
   issuance the liquidation value of the Preferred Shares, plus the aggregate
   amount of senior securities representing indebtedness, does not exceed 50% of
   the Fund's capital. Once Preferred Shares are issued and/or other forms of
   leverage are used, the asset value and market price of the common shares and
   the yield to common stockholders will be more volatile.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during the fiscal
     period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the purchase
     of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of common
     shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income
Fund Inc., (the "Fund") as of October 31, 2003, and the related statement of
operations, statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights for the
one day period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers or other appropriate auditing procedures where replies
from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. at October 31, 2003,
the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its financial

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (Unaudited)

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current Shares are
registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as of the
first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the dividend payment date, to
apply the amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares
(less their PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Plan Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend except where temporary curtailment or suspension
of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day during the purchase
period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent will not make any
further open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full
dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to the
uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue new
Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the purchase
period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net asset value
per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus estimated
brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the terms
specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the dividend reinvestment purchase comparison under the
Plan, (a) the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last
sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or
if not so listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean
between the closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on
such date and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be
the net asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the
Fund. All dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or
Shares) shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

                                       17

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]


ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Board has  delegated  to  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger  Berman") the
responsibility  to vote  proxies  related to the  securities  held in the Fund's
portfolios.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by the Board to
vote proxies  related to portfolio  securities in the best interests of the Fund
and its  stockholders.  The Board  permits  Neuberger  Berman to contract with a
third party to obtain proxy voting and related services,  including  research of
current issues.
<PAGE>

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger  Berman has voting  authority,  including the Fund. The Proxy
Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman  addresses any conflicts that
may arise  between its  interests and those of its clients with respect to proxy
voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.


ITEM 8. [RESERVED]


ITEM 9. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)    Based on an  evaluation of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as
       defined in rule  30a-2(c)  under the Act) as of a date  within 90 days of
       the  filing  date of this  document,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
       Treasurer  and  Principal   Financial  and  Accounting   Officer  of  the
       Registrant  have concluded that such  disclosure  controls and procedures
       are  effectively  designed  to ensure  that  information  required  to be
       disclosed  by the  Registrant  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the
       Registrant's  management  to allow timely  decisions  regarding  required
       disclosure.

(b)    There were no significant  changes in the Registrant's  internal controls
       over financial reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
       occurred  during  the  Registrant's  second  fiscal  half-year  that have
       materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
       Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
<PAGE>

ITEM 10. EXHIBITS

(a)    A copy of the Code of Ethics is filed as Exhibit 10(a)(1).

(b)    The  certifications  required by Rule 30a-2 of the Investment Company Act
       of 1940, as amended,  and Sections 302 and 906 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act
       of 2002 are attached hereto.

extent that the Registrant specifically incorporates them by reference.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered  investment companies within the
Neuberger  Berman Fund complex  (each,  a "Company")  applies to each  Company's
Principal   Executive  Officer,   Principal   Financial  Officer  and  Principal
Accounting  Officer (the "Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between  personal  and  professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable  disclosure in reports
         and documents  that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED  OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE  ETHICALLY  ACTUAL,  POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics  and  should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual  conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of,  or his or her  service  to,  the
Company.  For example,  a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential  conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances,  interfere with the
interests  of the Company or the  Officer's  service to the  Company,  but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances  may create an  "apparent  conflict of  interest"  even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered  Officer  owns a thinly  traded  security  that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain  actual or  potential  conflicts  of interest  may arise out of the
relationships  between Covered  Officers and the Company and already are subject
to  conflict  of  interest  provisions  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940
("Investment  Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered  Officers may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property)  with a Fund  because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Company.  The compliance  programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc.,  Neuberger  Berman,  LLC  (collectively  referred  to as  the  "investment
adviser")  and each  Company are  designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,
violations  of these  provisions.  This Code does not,  and is not  intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  actual or potential  conflicts  may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered  Officers are also  officers or  employees.  As a result,  this Code
recognizes that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment  adviser,  or for both),
be involved in establishing  policies and implementing  decisions that will have
different  effects on the  adviser and the  Company.  The  participation  of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship
between the  Company  and the  investment  adviser  and is  consistent  with the
performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity  with the provisions of the Investment  Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled  ethically.  In addition,  it is recognized by the Companies'  Boards of
Trustees/Directors  ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees  of one or more other  investment  companies  covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code,  but  Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these  examples  are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                       2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the  Company  to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the
         individual  personal  benefit of the  Covered  Officer  rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate  against  any other  Covered  Officer,  or any  employee of a
         Company,  its service  providers,  or the affiliated  persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or  potential  conflict of interest  situations  that
should  always be approved by the  Company's  Chief Legal  Officer1 if material.
Covered  Officers are  encouraged  to discuss  with the Chief Legal  Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service  as a director  on the board of any public or private  company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the  receipt  of any  entertainment  from any  company  with  which the
         Company  has  current or  prospective  business  dealings  unless  such
         entertainment is business-related,  reasonable in cost,  appropriate as
         to time and place,  and not so  frequent  as to raise any  question  of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect  financial  interest in  commissions,  transaction
         charges  or  spreads  paid  by  the  Company  for  effecting  portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming  shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment,  such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each  Covered  Officer  must  familiarize  himself or herself  with the
         disclosure  requirements  generally  applicable  to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
         to misrepresent,  facts about the Company to others,  whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's  trustees/directors and
         auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators   and   self-regulatory
         organizations;

     o   each Covered Officer should,  to the extent  appropriate  within his or
         her area of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in the  reports  and
         documents the  Companies  file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered  Officer should promote  compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing  to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board  that he or she has  complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report  on  the  Company's  Questionnaire  for  Trustees/Directors  and
         Officers,  where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships  giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer  promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and  circumstances  that he or she knows are a violation  of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is  responsible  for applying this Code to specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.2  However,  any approvals or
waivers3  sought by the  Principal  Executive  Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal  Officer is  authorized to consult,  as  appropriate,  with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the  Independent  Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action  within a  reasonable
     period of time regarding a material  departure from a provision of the code
     of  ethics  that  has  been  made  known to an  executive  officer"  of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.

     The Companies will follow these procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome  of the  investigation,  and  whether  or not the  Chief  Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially  reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred,  it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate  modifications to,
         applicable   policies  and  procedures;   notification  to  appropriate
         personnel of the investment  adviser or its board; or a  recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o   The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code  shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted by the  Companies  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable  to  registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies,  the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal  underwriter,  or other  service  providers  purport to apply a lesser
standard  to the  behavior  or  activities  of the  Covered  Officers,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies'  and the investment  adviser's  codes of
ethics  under Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company  Act and the  investment
adviser's more detailed  policies and  procedures set forth in Neuberger  Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance  Manual are separate  requirements  applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified  by a majority  vote of the Board,  including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed  to anyone  other  than the  appropriate  Company,  its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII.  INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
