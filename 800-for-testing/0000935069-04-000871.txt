Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser  Hedge Fund  Portfolios LLC -
Series G ("Multi-Strategy"  or the "Portfolio") was up an estimated 10.39% since
March 2003, and is up 7.87%  annualized since its inception in January 2003.

For the same time period, the S&P 500 was up 35.09%,  while the Lehman Aggregate
Bond Index was up 5.40%.  The VIX equity  volatility  Index ("VIX Index") ranged
between  14% and 33%  during  the past  twelve  months.  Results  for all of the
Portfolio's  hedge fund  Rational  Strategy  Groups (RSGs) were positive for the
past year.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW

DISCRETIONARY
The discretionary RSG turned in positive performance during the fiscal year from
March 2003 to March 2004.  Equity  markets  staged a powerful  rally  during the
second  quarter 2003,  driven by investors'  increased  appetite for risk and an
expectation  that an economic  recovery  would take hold.  The third quarter saw
global equity markets  continue to rally,  supported by positive news flow and a
relatively benign macro political  environment.  This RSG's positive performance
during the fourth quarter of 2003 was thanks to the ongoing positive performance
of the global equity markets.  The quarter was characterized by moderate trading
volume,  accompanied  by falling  volatility.  For first  quarter of 2004 global
equity  markets showed strong  performance in January and February,  prompted by
positive economic news and global economic growth.  However, this trend reversed
in March  due to weak  economic  news in the  Eurozone  coupled  with the  train
bombing in Spain,  causing a decline in global equity markets and a rally in the
fixed income markets.  Japan was the exception,  however,  as improved  domestic
demand caused the opposite to occur.  The U.S.  dollar  appreciated  against the
other major currencies by the end of the quarter.  There was also a strong rally
in commodities throughout the quarter,  notably in grains and precious metals in
March 2004.

One new U.S.-focused manager was added to the Portfolio during the third quarter
of 2003,  seeking to improve the overall  quality of the  Portfolio.  Two global
macro managers and one U.S. focused  long/short equity manager were added to the
Portfolio  during  the first  quarter of 2004.  One Japan  focused  manager  was
redeemed from the Portfolio in February.  In addition,  adjustments were made to
existing  allocations  throughout the year to move them in line with objectives.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE
Equity arbitrage strategies were generally positive over the past twelve months.
The second quarter of 2003 was satisfactory for this RSG. The accelerated buying
of stocks led to higher returns for providers of short-term liquidity.  Although
equity volatility  decreased as the quarter wore on, there was a rotation out of
low growth value stocks into more speculative  stocks,  in particular those most
devalued in the first quarter. The positive performance continued into the third
quarter of last year as the  economy  continued  to improve  creating a positive
background  for the equity  market.  The last quarter of 2003 was uneventful for
equity arbitrage strategies as they produced mixed performance amid strong gains
in the equity markets.  This RSG was slightly  positive during the first quarter
of 2004, which saw a downturn in the global financial markets by quarter-end due
to rising oil prices,  terrorist threats, and job market concerns.  January 2004
was a relatively  uneventful month, as all the major U.S. indices were positive,
earnings  reports were mostly  positive,  and  volatility  was low. In February,
there  was a shift  out of  low-quality,  high-beta  stocks,  in favor of higher
quality  names since the  Federal  Reserve  indicated a sooner than  anticipated
raise in interest rates in late January.  The uninspiring economic and corporate
news at the end of the quarter gave rise to higher  volatility and  correlations
within and across industrial sectors.

Throughout the year,  allocations to existing  allocations were adjusted to keep
them in line with objectives.

FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE
Fixed income  arbitrage  strategies  were positive over the past twelve  months.
This RSG performed well during the second quarter of 2003, despite a challenging
backdrop.  Fixed  income  markets  across the world  spent  most of the  quarter
rallying aggressively as investors believed that central banks would continue to
aggressively cut interest rates. By the end of the second quarter, however, when
the U.S.  Federal  Reserve  disappointed  investors by only cutting  rates by 25
basis  points  (bps),  global  fixed  income  markets  quickly and  dramatically
reversed.  This RSG's  performance  suffered during the third quarter of 2003 as
10-year Treasury yields,  which began the quarter at their lows,  traded as high
as 4.6% during the quarter,  before settling at 3.9%.  Two-year  Treasury yields
closed at 1.5%,  up 16 bps, as the  Federal  Reserve  revealed a relaxed  policy
built on a view that  inflation  would remain in check and that  growth,  though
strong in the near term,  would not necessarily be sustainable.  The yield curve
therefore  ended the quarter 26 bps steeper at 247 bps.  Ten-year  swap  spreads
ballooned  from 34 bps to 66 bps  before  shrinking  back  to 42  bps.  Volatile
interest rate market fundamentals drove short-dated  volatilities  higher, while
technical factors actually brought longer dated implied  swaptions  volatilities
lower. Fixed income strategies were essentially flat for the last quarter of the
year,  which was relatively  quiet for fixed income  managers,  as many relative
value  relationships  remained in a tight range. No major themes emerged. On the
positive  side,  profits were centered on various  futures basis trades and swap
spread trades. On the negative side, losses occurred  primarily in cross-country
curve trades

and options trades.  Fixed income arbitrage strategies remained essentially flat
again for the first quarter of this year.  The beginning of the quarter showed a
few volatile  weeks with the bond market  rallying in the second week of January
when the disappointing December employment report came out, and selling off near
the end of the month when the Federal Reserve dropped the long-standing  promise
to hold rates steady for a  "considerable  period" from its statement.  February
marked the third straight  monthly decline in yields,  the longest stretch since
September of 2002, and the quarter-end  showed yields  continuing to trade in an
increasingly  narrow range.  The market witnessed a strong rally towards the end
of the quarter  immediately  after the weak February  payroll report came out on
March 5th, followed by a relatively uneventful period.

Over the past year, one mortgage  manager was added to the Portfolio in order to
further diversify fixed income exposure,  while another mortgage focused manager
was completely redeemed from the Portfolio. In addition, allocations to existing
managers were adjusted throughout the year to keep them in line with objectives.

EVENT DRIVEN PLUS
Event driven plus strategies had very strong  performance since the beginning of
the fiscal year in March 2003. This RSG performed well during the second quarter
of 2003,  as most  managers  in this RSG turned in varying  degrees of  positive
performance.  The  continuation  of the  rally in  sub-investment  grade  credit
created a backdrop for profit generation.  The Bear Stearns High Yield Index, up
9.90% for the quarter,  continued to perform well following the massive sell-off
in sub-investment  grade credit last summer. As has been the case throughout the
rally, the weakest rated credits were the quarter's biggest winners. A generally
improving  sub-investment grade credit market provided  opportunities for profit
generation  in the third  quarter of 2003,  as the Bear Stearns High Yield Index
finished up 2.4% for these three months.  The stable yield  environment  enabled
managers to capture some carry from their long  positions  and  favorable  steps
forward  in  various  bankruptcy  restructuring  processes  provided  additional
positive performance. This strategy was also solidly profitable during the final
quarter of 2003. A continuation of the rally in sub-investment grade credit (the
Bear  Stearns High Yield Index was up 6.2%)  extended  what has been a favorable
environment for strong performance for event driven strategies. During the first
quarter of 2004, the rally in sub-investment grade credit continued,  especially
over the first two weeks of the year.  In February,  though it was a challenging
month, this strategy  continued to be profitable even with the Bear Stearns High
Yield Index being down on a total  return basis for only the second month in the
last 16. The end of the quarter was mixed for the macro  environment with credit
starting off well and volatility  being neutral in the beginning of March,  only
for both to reverse mid-month, and then again in the final week of the quarter.

Over the past twelve  months,  the  Investment  Adviser  redeemed fully from one
convertible arbitrage manager as the senior portfolio manager left their firm. A
new  multi-strategy  event driven manager was added,  with a particular focus on
credit to further  diversify the  Portfolio.  Also,  one  convertible  arbitrage
manager was removed from the  Portfolio,  as was one distressed  manager.  These
moves were made to reduce credit exposure in the Portfolio and to make remaining
manager  positions more meaningful to the overall  Portfolio's  performance.  In
addition, one volatility-oriented convertible arbitrage manager and one European
focused  event  driven  manager were added to the  Portfolio  to obtain  further
diversification  and additional  allocations  were made to existing  managers to
keep the Portfolio in line with diversification objectives going forward.

MARKET OUTLOOK

DISCRETIONARY
- -------------
April started off on a good note with the release of a surprisingly  strong U.S.
jobs report.  Before the release, some economists wondered about inconsistencies
between the  employment  figures and other  economic  data.  Now, at least for a
moment,  the economic  data seems to be  supportive  of those  investors who are
bullish on the economy. Although equity valuations do not appear cheap, it seems
that there is enough  bullishness  among market  participants  to propel  equity
markets  higher.  While some long-short  equity managers  reduced their net long
exposure during the March  sell-off,  most of them remain bullish on the market.
At the same time, investors' sentiments may change quickly if there is any major
disappointing  economic news or a new terrorist attack. In fixed income markets,
we may have seen the lows in interest  rates with yields  poised to move higher.
Currency  markets still appear to be range bound in the near term. If there is a
continued  global  recovery,  commodity  markets  should  perform  well,  aiding
discretionary and trend-following CTAs. Overall,  despite the challenging global
environment,  the Investment  Adviser  believes that  significant  opportunities
still exist.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE
After several months of disappointing  employment news, the better-than expected
rise in job creation  finally arrived on April 2nd, which  immediately  caused a
sell-off in bonds and a buying frenzy in stocks.  Additionally,  dollar strength
and a muchneeded  pause in the rise of oil prices also  contributed to the stock
market's gains. For the first week of April,  the Dow Jones  Industrial  Average
added 2.5%,  the S&P rose 3.4% and the Nasdaq jumped 5%. Not  surprisingly,  the
more  economically  sensitive  areas of the market led the way with  technology,
industrial and basic  materials up between 4% and 5%. The laggards were the more
defensive names,  including  utilities,  financial stocks, and cyclicals,  which
were up between 1% and 2.5%. The

rise in cyclicals seems to reinforce  investors' belief that the economy appears
in good shape.  If the earnings  reports that come out in the next few weeks are
as good as  expected,  the  equity  market  may  resume  its  upward  path.  The
Investment  Adviser believes that the Portfolio's  discretionary  managers might
then bounce back from last  month's  negative  performance,  assuming  terrorist
related  concerns  diminish  and the economy  continues  to advance.  Given this
scenario,  equity  market  neutral  managers may  continue to generate  positive
returns  with  investors  paying  closer  attention  to quality  and  valuation.
Statistical  arbitrage  managers are also currently expected to perform well, as
the current low levels of  volatility  are  unlikely to  continue.

FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE
- ----------------------
The  308,000  non-farm  jobs  added in March  versus  the  consensus  of 120,000
immediately  caused  Treasury  yields to move higher,  swap spreads to widen and
implied  volatility  to surge.  Between March 26th and the morning of April 2nd,
yields on the 5-year  and  10-year  notes  rose by 31 bps and 28 bps,  while the
yields  on  the  2-year  and  30-year  treasuries  rose  by 27 bps  and 21  bps,
respectively. Thus, the short end of the curve steepened, while the intermediate
(5's/10's) and long end  (10's/30's)  flattened.  Meanwhile,  TIPS  outperformed
nominals,  with  break-even  spreads  widening on both  short-term and long-term
maturities.  The sharp movement in rates, combined with increased volatility, is
likely to result in short-term  dislocations,  and hence provide greater trading
opportunities  for global rates focused  managers.  Mortgages  cheapened through
much of March,  as lower  mortgage  rates  reignited  prepayment  concerns.  The
performance  of mortgage  managers will depend on how the key factors  affecting
mortgages,  such as supply and demand,  prepayment,  and volatility  play out in
April.

EVENT DRIVEN PLUS
- ------------------
The  Investment  Adviser's  outlook  for  event  driven  strategies  is  largely
unchanged going farward.  With respect to the Portfolio's  convertible arbitrage
allocation,  the  Investment  Adviser  continues  to  favor  volatility-oriented
arbitrageurs.  This decision  paid off in March.  Following  interim  volatility
highs in  mid-March,  the VIX index  (one  measure of broad  equity  volatility)
traded back down to levels  where the  potential  for  realizing  value  through
convertible  positioning appears attractive.  Increased deal activity bodes well
for  merger  arbitrageurs  and event  driven  specialists.  In terms of new deal
announcements, March slowed relative to the first two months of the year; global
deal volume for the 1st quarter of 2004, at $538  billion,  was more than double
that of the same  periods  for both 2002 and 2003 and 35% more than in the first
quarter of 2001. One must go back to the 1st quarter of 2000, the last rich year
for merger  arbitrage  returns,  to see volume greater than current  levels.  As
mentioned  last month,  with respect to  distressed  investing,  the  Investment
Adviser believes it may pay to be more trading-oriented in the near-term, as the
broad market rally may be nearer to its end than to its  beginning.  Once again,
specific credit  selection should prove to be very important to alpha generation
going  forward.  Lastly,  the  Investment  Adviser is always wary of  unforeseen
economic or geopolitical  events that could temporarily  impair short volatility
strategies  like  distressed  investing  and  merger  arbitrage.   However,  the
Investment  Adviser views its convertible  arbitrage exposure as a hedge against
such a scenario.  In addition,  many of the Portfolio's  distressed  specialists
have built cash reserves and have increased  short exposure given current market
conditions.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("the  Company")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
         Company  on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
         Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series G is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series G can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series G from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or "the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  G  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series G values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         a.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

                                                                  (continued)

CITIGROUP ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES G


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2004 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series G's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series G, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series G's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-strategy Series G does not take a liquidity discount on
         any  Investment   Funds  held.  The  underlying   investments  of  each
         Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as described in each
         Investment Fund's financial statements. The Investment Funds may invest
         a  portion  of  their  assets  in  restricted   securities   and  other
         investments that are illiquid.

         b.  FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series G's subsequent
         registration  under  the 1933  Act have  been  deferred  and are  being
         amortized over the twelve months commencing after the effective date of
         such registration statement.

         c.  INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series G's taxable income
         or loss.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2004 (CONTINUED)

         d.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus accrued interest.

         e.  CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

         Contributions   received   in   advance   of   $22,070,175   represents
         subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts on
         April 1, 2004. Such amount is largely represented within the short term
         investments  balance  as  depicted  on  the  accompanying  schedule  of
         investments.

         f.  USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee equal to 0.188%
         (2.25% on an annualized  basis) of end of month Members'  capital.  The
         Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  related  expenses of
         $56,343 to  Multi-Strategy  Series G during  the year  ended  March 31,
         2004.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent, which may be affiliated with the
         Adviser, will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor
         in the Company whose Units the agent places. The specific amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent

         fees are deducted from an investor's gross contribution amount.

         On March 18, 2004,  the Company  entered into an agreement with a third
         party to act as an additional placement agent for Multi-Strategy Series
         G Units.  Placement  fees may  range  from 0 to 3%.  In  addition,  the
         Adviser may also pay a portion of its  management fee to such placement
         agent.

         Multi-Strategy  Series G pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on an
         annualized basis) for  administration  based primarily upon average net
         assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and will reimburse  certain
         expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  has retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),  an
         independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A.,
         to  assist  in the  performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  PFPC
         provides certain accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.

         Each  Director  who is not an  "interested  person"  of  Multi-Strategy
         Series G, as defined by the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of
         $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of the Board of  Directors of $500.  Any
         Director who is an  "interested  person" does not receive any annual or
         other fee from  Multi-Strategy  Series G. All Directors are  reimbursed
         for all  reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed
         related  to  Directors  by  Multi-Strategy  Series G for the year ended
         March 31, 2004 were $21,184.

         PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, N.A.) serves as custodian
         of Multi-Strategy Series G's assets and provides custodial services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and
         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series G.

     5.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  Units  may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional  subscriptions for Units in Multi-Strategy Series G. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  to
         repurchase Units from Members pursuant to written tenders by members on
         such terms and  conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects  that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to  repurchase  Units from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series G for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

     6.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Investment  Funds  in which
         Multi-Strategy Series G invests trade various financial instruments and
         enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk.
         These  include,  but are not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,
         writing option contracts and entering into equity swaps.

as of March 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser  Hedge Fund  Portfolios LLC -
Series M  ("Multi-Strategy"  or the "Portfolio") was up an estimated 8.05% since
March 2003, and is up 5.78%  annualized since its inception in January 2003.

For the same time period, the S&P 500 was up 35.09%,  while the Lehman Aggregate
Bond Index was up 5.40%.  The VIX equity  volatility  Index ("VIX Index") ranged
between  14% and 33%  during  the past  twelve  months.  Results  for all of the
Portfolio's  hedge fund  Rational  Strategy  Groups (RSGs) were positive for the
past year.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW

DISCRETIONARY
The discretionary RSG turned in positive performance during the fiscal year from
March 2003 to March 2004.  Equity  markets  staged a powerful  rally  during the
second  quarter 2003,  driven by investors'  increased  appetite for risk and an
expectation  that an economic  recovery  would take hold.  The third quarter saw
global equity markets  continue to rally,  supported by positive news flow and a
relatively benign macro political  environment.  This RSG's positive performance
during the fourth quarter of 2003 was thanks to the ongoing positive performance
of the global equity markets.  The quarter was characterized by moderate trading
volume,  accompanied  by falling  volatility.  For first  quarter of 2004 global
equity  markets showed strong  performance in January and February,  prompted by
positive economic news and global economic growth.  However, this trend reversed
in March  due to weak  economic  news in the  Eurozone  coupled  with the  train
bombing in Spain,  causing a decline in global equity markets and a rally in the
fixed income markets.  Japan was the exception,  however,  as improved  domestic
demand caused the opposite to occur.  The U.S.  dollar  appreciated  against the
other major currencies by the end of the quarter.  There was also a strong rally
in commodities throughout the quarter,  notably in grains and precious metals in
March 2004.

One new U.S.-focused manager was added to the Portfolio during the third quarter
of 2003,  seeking to improve the overall  quality of the  Portfolio.  Two global
macro managers and one U.S. focused  long/short equity manager were added to the
Portfolio  during  the first  quarter of 2004.  One Japan  focused  manager  was
redeemed from the Portfolio in February.  In addition,  adjustments were made to
existing  allocations  throughout the year to move them in line with objectives.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE
Equity arbitrage strategies were generally positive over the past twelve months.
The second quarter of 2003 was satisfactory for this RSG. The accelerated buying
of stocks led to higher returns for providers of short-term liquidity.  Although
equity volatility  decreased as the quarter wore on, there was a rotation out of
low growth value stocks into more speculative  stocks,  in particular those most
devalued in the first quarter. The positive performance continued into the third
quarter of last year as the  economy  continued  to improve  creating a positive
background  for the equity  market.  The last quarter of 2003 was uneventful for
equity arbitrage strategies as they produced mixed performance amid strong gains
in the equity markets.  This RSG was slightly  positive during the first quarter
of 2004, which saw a downturn in the global financial markets by quarter-end due
to rising oil prices,  terrorist threats, and job market concerns.  January 2004
was a relatively  uneventful month, as all the major U.S. indices were positive,
earnings  reports were mostly  positive,  and  volatility  was low. In February,
there  was a shift  out of  low-quality,  high-beta  stocks,  in favor of higher
quality  names since the  Federal  Reserve  indicated a sooner than  anticipated
raise in interest rates in late January.  The uninspiring economic and corporate
news at the end of the quarter gave rise to higher  volatility and  correlations
within and across industrial sectors.

Throughout the year,  allocations to existing  allocations were adjusted to keep
them in line with  objectives.

FIXED INCOME  ARBITRAGE
Fixed income  arbitrage  strategies  were positive over the past twelve  months.
This RSG performed well during the second quarter of 2003, despite a challenging
backdrop.  Fixed  income  markets  across the world  spent  most of the  quarter
rallying aggressively as investors believed that central banks would continue to
aggressively cut interest rates. By the end of the second quarter, however, when
the U.S.  Federal  Reserve  disappointed  investors by only cutting  rates by 25
basis  points  (bps),  global  fixed  income  markets  quickly and  dramatically
reversed.  This RSG's  performance  suffered during the third quarter of 2003 as
10-year Treasury yields,  which began the quarter at their lows,  traded as high
as 4.6% during the quarter,  before settling at 3.9%.  Two-year  Treasury yields
closed at 1.5%,  up 16 bps, as the  Federal  Reserve  revealed a relaxed  policy
built on a view that  inflation  would remain in check and that  growth,  though
strong in the near term,  would not necessarily be sustainable.  The yield curve
therefore  ended the quarter 26 bps steeper at 247 bps.  Ten-year  swap  spreads
ballooned  from 34 bps to 66 bps  before  shrinking  back  to 42  bps.  Volatile
interest rate market fundamentals drove short-dated  volatilities  higher, while
technical factors actually brought longer dated implied  swaptions  volatilities
lower. Fixed income strategies were essentially flat for the last quarter of the
year,  which was relatively  quiet for fixed income  managers,  as many relative
value  relationships  remained in a tight range. No major themes emerged. On the
positive  side,  profits were centered on various  futures basis trades and swap
spread trades. On the negative side, losses occurred  primarily in cross-country
curve trades

and options trades.  Fixed income arbitrage strategies remained essentially flat
again for the first quarter of this year.  The beginning of the quarter showed a
few volatile  weeks with the bond market  rallying in the second week of January
when the disappointing December employment report came out, and selling off near
the end of the month when the Federal Reserve dropped the long-standing  promise
to hold rates steady for a  "considerable  period" from its statement.  February
marked the third straight  monthly decline in yields,  the longest stretch since
September of 2002, and the quarter-end  showed yields  continuing to trade in an
increasingly  narrow range.  The market witnessed a strong rally towards the end
of the quarter  immediately  after the weak February  payroll report came out on
March 5th, followed by a relatively uneventful period.

Over the past year, one mortgage  manager was added to the Portfolio in order to
further diversify fixed income exposure,  while another mortgage focused manager
was completely redeemed from the Portfolio.

EVENT DRIVEN PLUS
Event driven plus strategies had very strong  performance since the beginning of
the fiscal year in March 2003. This RSG performed well during the second quarter
of 2003,  as most  managers  in this RSG turned in varying  degrees of  positive
performance.  The  continuation  of the  rally in  sub-investment  grade  credit
created a backdrop for profit generation.  The Bear Stearns High Yield Index, up
9.90% for the quarter,  continued to perform well following the massive sell-off
in sub-investment  grade credit last summer. As has been the case throughout the
rally, the weakest rated credits were the quarter's biggest winners. A generally
improving  sub-investment grade credit market provided  opportunities for profit
generation  in the third  quarter of 2003,  as the Bear Stearns High Yield Index
finished up 2.4% for these three months.  The stable yield  environment  enabled
managers to capture some carry from their long  positions  and  favorable  steps
forward  in  various  bankruptcy  restructuring  processes  provided  additional
positive  performance.  This  strategy was solidly  profitable  during the final
quarter of 2003. A continuation of the rally in sub-investment grade credit (the
Bear  Stearns High Yield Index was up 6.2%)  extended  what has been a favorable
environment for strong performance for event driven strategies. During the first
quarter of 2004, the rally in sub-investment grade credit continued,  especially
over the first two weeks of the year.  In February,  though it was a challenging
month, this strategy  continued to be profitable even with the Bear Stearns High
Yield Index being down on a total  return basis for only the second month in the
last 16. The end of the quarter was mixed for the macro  environment with credit
starting off well and volatility  being neutral in the beginning of March,  only
for both to reverse mid-month, and then again in the final week of the quarter.

In the past  twelve  months,  the  Investment  Adviser  redeemed  fully from one
convertible arbitrage manager as the senior portfolio manager left their firm. A
new  multi-strategy  event driven manager was added,  with a particular focus on
credit  to  further  diversify  the  Portfolio.  In  addition,  one  convertible
arbitrage manager was removed from the Portfolio, as was one distressed manager.
These moves were made to reduce  credit  exposure in the  Portfolio  and to make
remaining  manager   positions  more  meaningful  to  the  overall   Portfolio's
performance.

MARKET OUTLOOK

DISCRETIONARY
- -------------
April started off on a good note with the release of a surprisingly  strong U.S.
jobs report.  Before the release, some economists wondered about inconsistencies
between the  employment  figures and other  economic  data.  Now, at least for a
moment,  the economic  data seems to be  supportive  of those  investors who are
bullish on the economy. Although equity valuations do not appear cheap, it seems
that there is enough  bullishness  among market  participants  to propel  equity
markets  higher.  While some long-short  equity managers  reduced their net long
exposure during the March  sell-off,  most of them remain bullish on the market.
At the same time, investors' sentiments may change quickly if there is any major
disappointing  economic news or a new terrorist attack. In fixed income markets,
we may have seen the lows in interest  rates with yields  poised to move higher.
Currency  markets still appear to be range bound in the near term. If there is a
continued  global  recovery,  commodity  markets  should  perform  well,  aiding
discretionary and trend-following CTAs. Overall,  despite the challenging global
environment,  the Investment  Adviser  believes that  significant  opportunities
still exist.

EQUITY ARBITRAGE
- -----------------
After several months of disappointing  employment news, the better-than expected
rise in job creation  finally arrived on April 2nd, which  immediately  caused a
sell-off in bonds and a buying frenzy in stocks.  Additionally,  dollar strength
and a muchneeded  pause in the rise of oil prices also  contributed to the stock
market's gains. For the first week of April,  the Dow Jones  Industrial  Average
added 2.5%,  the S&P rose 3.4% and the Nasdaq jumped 5%. Not  surprisingly,  the
more  economically  sensitive  areas of the market led the way with  technology,
industrial and basic  materials up between 4% and 5%. The laggards were the more
defensive names,  including  utilities,  financial stocks, and cyclicals,  which
were up between 1% and 2.5%. The rise in cyclicals seems to reinforce investors'
belief that the economy appears in good shape. If the earnings reports that come
out in the next few weeks are as good as expected,  the equity market may resume
its  upward  path.  The  Investment   Adviser   believes  that  the  Portfolio's
discretionary  managers  might  then  bounce  back  from last  month's  negative
performance,

assuming  terrorist  related  concerns  diminish  and the economy  continues  to
advance.  Given this scenario,  equity market  neutral  managers may continue to
generate  positive returns with investors paying closer attention to quality and
valuation. Statistical arbitrage managers are also currently expected to perform
well, as the current low levels of volatility are unlikely to continue.

FIXED INCOME ARBITRAGE
- ----------------------
The  308,000  non-farm  jobs  added in March  versus  the  consensus  of 120,000
immediately  caused  Treasury  yields to move higher,  swap spreads to widen and
implied  volatility  to surge.  Between March 26th and the morning of April 2nd,
yields on the 5-year  and  10-year  notes  rose by 31 bps and 28 bps,  while the
yields  on  the  2-year  and  30-year  treasuries  rose  by 27 bps  and 21  bps,
respectively. Thus, the short end of the curve steepened, while the intermediate
(5's/10's) and long end  (10's/30's)  flattened.  Meanwhile,  TIPS  outperformed
nominals,  with  break-even  spreads  widening on both  short-term and long-term
maturities.  The sharp movement in rates, combined with increased volatility, is
likely to result in short-term  dislocations,  and hence provide greater trading
opportunities  for global rates focused  managers.  Mortgages  cheapened through
much of March,  as lower  mortgage  rates  reignited  prepayment  concerns.  The
performance  of mortgage  managers will depend on how the key factors  affecting
mortgages,  such as supply and demand,  prepayment,  and volatility  play out in
April.

EVENT DRIVEN PLUS
- -----------------
The  Investment  Adviser's  outlook  for  event  driven  strategies  is  largely
unchanged going farward.  With respect to the Portfolio's  convertible arbitrage
allocation,  the  Investment  Adviser  continues  to  favor  volatility-oriented
arbitrageurs.  This decision  paid off in March.  Following  interim  volatility
highs in  mid-March,  the VIX index  (one  measure of broad  equity  volatility)
traded back down to levels  where the  potential  for  realizing  value  through
convertible  positioning appears attractive.  Increased deal activity bodes well
for  merger  arbitrageurs  and event  driven  specialists.  In terms of new deal
announcements, March slowed relative to the first two months of the year; global
deal volume for the 1st quarter of 2004, at $538  billion,  was more than double
that of the same  periods  for both 2002 and 2003 and 35% more than in the first
quarter of 2001. One must go back to the 1st quarter of 2000, the last rich year
for merger  arbitrage  returns,  to see volume greater than current  levels.  As
mentioned  last month,  with respect to  distressed  investing,  the  Investment
Adviser believes it may pay to be more trading-oriented in the near-term, as the
broad market rally may be nearer to its end than to its  beginning.  Once again,
specific credit  selection should prove to be very important to alpha generation
going  forward.  Lastly,  the  Investment  Adviser is always wary of  unforeseen
economic or geopolitical  events that could temporarily  impair short volatility
strategies  like  distressed  investing  and  merger  arbitrage.   However,  the
Investment  Adviser views its convertible  arbitrage exposure as a hedge against
such a scenario.  In addition,  many of the Portfolio's  distressed  specialists
have built cash reserves and have increased  short exposure given current market
conditions.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("the  Company")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
         Company  on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
         Investment  Company  Act of 1940  (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series M is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series M can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series M from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI",  or the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series M to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series M values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         a.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

                                                                     (continued)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2004 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series M's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series M, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  M can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series M's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-Strategy Series M does not take a liquidity discount on
         any  Investment   Funds  held.  The  underlying   investments  of  each
         Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as described in each
         Investment Fund's financial statements. The Investment Funds may invest
         a  portion  of  their  assets  in  restricted   securities   and  other
         investments that are illiquid.

         b.  FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series M's subsequent
         registration  under  the 1933  Act have  been  deferred  and are  being
         amortized over the twelve months commencing after the effective date of
         such registration statement.

         c.  INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series M's taxable income
         or loss.

         d.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A.  account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at
         cost plus accrued interest.

         e.  CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

         Contributions    received   in   advance   of   $4,202,200   represents
         subscriptions  received to be credited to Members'  capital accounts on
         April  1,  2004.   Such  amount  is  included  within  the  short  term
         investments  balance  as  depicted  on  the  accompanying  schedule  of
         investments.

         f.  USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series M. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee equal to 0.167%
         (2.00% on an annualized  basis) of end of month Members'  capital.  The
         Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  related  expenses of
         $32,037 to Multi-Strategy Series M during the year ended March 31,
         2004.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent, which may be affiliated with the
         Adviser, will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor
         in the Company whose Units the Agent places. The specific amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series M Units.  For the year  ended  March 31,
         2004, CGM earned $418,975 in placement fees on Multi-Strategy  Series M
         Units.  Such fees are deducted  from an investor's  gross  contribution
         amount.

         On March 18, 2004,  the Company  entered into an agreement with a third
         party to act as an additional placement agent for Multi-Strategy Series
         M Units.  Placement  fees may  range  from 0 to 3%.  In  addition,  the

         $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of the Board of  Directors of $500.  Any
         Director who is an  "interested  person" does not receive any annual or
         other fee from  Multi-Strategy  Series M. All Directors are  reimbursed
         for all  reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed
         related to Directors by Multi-Strategy Series M for the period April 1,
         2003 through March 31, 2004 were $14,914.

         PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, N.A.) serves as custodian
         of Multi-Strategy Series M's assets and provides custodial services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and

                                 CODE OF CONDUCT
         ==================================================================


         Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC (the "Adviser" or "CAI") and
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the
"Company") are each committed to the highest standards of professional
excellence and ethics. The interests of the Company's members and other advisory
clients of CAI are paramount and must be placed at all times ahead of the
personal interests of Company/CAI personnel. It is critical that there be no
actual or potential conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict.
In addition, Company/CAI personnel should not take advantage of their position
in the firm to obtain a benefit that would not be generally available. The
actual or apparent conflict of interest from such actions would be extremely
harmful to the reputation of the Company and of CAI and to investor
relationships.

         This Code of Conduct (the "Company Code") is intended to be a general
guideline and cannot address every specific situation which may arise. Specific
situations should be discussed with the Compliance Officer. In addition to the
Company Code, Company/CAI personnel should familiarize themselves with the
CITIGROUP GLOBAL INVESTMENTS Personal Securities Trading Policy (the "CGI
Policy") attached hereto as Appendix A, which is applicable to all Company
employees.

        F.     A security generally is "BEING CONSIDERED FOR PURCHASE OR SALE"

        J.     "INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR" of the Company means a director thereof

               Company, develops investment strategy or makes recommendations

II.     PERSONAL TRADING

        A.     PRE-CLEARANCE

               1. No Access Person shall purchase or sell a Security for a
personal account without obtaining approval in advance. Such approval shall be
obtained in advance in the manner set forth in the CGI Policy. Approval for the
purchase or sale of a Security is only valid for the day on which it is given.
Notwithstanding this general pre-clearance requirement, Access Persons are not
required to obtain pre-clearance for transactions in dividend reinvestment
programs, company sponsored stock purchase programs, rights offerings, and
involuntary situations (such as mergers).

               2. An Independent Director will not be subject to the
pre-clearance provisions of this Code unless the Independent Director knows, or
in the course of fulfilling his or her official duties as an Independent
Director should know, that, within the most recent fifteen (15) days, the
Company has purchased or sold, or considered for purchase or sale, the Security
under consideration for purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the
Independent Director.

        B.     PRIVATE PLACEMENTS

        No Investment Person (or other natural person in a control relationship
to the Company or the Adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations
made to the Company with regard to the purchase or sale of a Security by or on
behalf of the Company) shall acquire Securities in a private placement
transaction unless prior approval is obtained in the manner set
<PAGE>

forth in the CGI Policy (the individual's business head should also be consulted
as part of the prior approval process). If a Security is acquired in a private
placement transaction, the Investment Person (or other such control person, if
applicable) must disclose such ownership in any future discussions or decision
making process concerning the issuer of such Security and any subsequent
decision to acquire a Security issued by such issuer can only be made with the
concurrence of a Company Portfolio Manager other than such Investment Person (or
such other control person, if applicable).

        C.     INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

        The acquisition of Securities in an initial public offering by any
person subject to this Code is discouraged, but may be made if prior approval is
obtained in the manner set forth in the CGI Policy. In addition, the acquisition
of equity Securities in an initial public offering is prohibited under the CGI
Policy. Independent Directors are not subject to these pre-clearance provisions
with respect to their investments in Securities in an initial public offering
unless the Independent Director knows, or in the course of fulfilling his or her
official duties as an Independent Director should know, that, within the most
recent fifteen (15) days, the Company has purchased or sold, or considered for
purchase or sale, the Security under consideration for purchase or sale,
directly or indirectly, by the Independent Director.

        D.     BLACKOUT PERIODS

               1. No Access Person may buy or sell a Security if the Adviser is
buying or selling such Security (or a related Security) for or on behalf of an
Account for one business day before or after the Account's transactions are
executed or withdrawn. No Portfolio Manager may purchase or sell a security
within seven (7) calendar days before or after a day on which an Account which
he or she manages has traded in such Security (or a related Security). Any
profits realized on such a trade must be disgorged. Notwithstanding this general
blackout
<PAGE>

requirement, transactions exempt from pre-clearance under item II.A.(2) also are
exempt from this blackout requirement.

               2. An Independent Director will not be subject to the blackout
period provisions of this Code unless the Independent Director knows, or in the
course of fulfilling his or her official duties as an Independent Director
should know, that, within the most recent fifteen (15) days, the Company has
purchased or sold, or considered for purchase or sale, the Security under
consideration for purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the Independent
Director.

        E.     BAN ON CERTAIN TRADING

               1. No Access Person shall purchase or sell, directly or
indirectly, any Security which he or she knows, or should have known, at the
time of such purchase or sale is being considered for purchase or sale by an
Account or is being purchased or sold by an Account.

               2. No Access Person shall cause an Account to take action, or to
fail to take action, for the purpose of achieving a personal benefit. Examples
of this conduct include causing an Account to purchase a Security owned by the
Access Person for the purpose of supporting or driving up the price of the
Security, and causing an Account to refrain from selling a Security in an
attempt to protect the value of the Access Person's investment.

               3. No Access Person shall use knowledge of a transaction for an
Account to profit by the market effect of such transaction.

               4. Investment Persons shall not engage in the trading of
Securities on a short-term basis. No Investment Person shall be allowed to
profit from the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of the same or
equivalent Securities within a sixty (60) calendar day period. Any profit
realized on such a short-term trade must be disgorged. If unforeseen
circumstances require the sale of a Security within such sixty (60) calendar day
period,
<PAGE>

exceptions to the prohibition on sale may be requested from the Company's
Compliance Officer or his or her designate.

               5. The sale of a call on an individual stock that you do not own
(I.E., a short call) is prohibited, as is the sale of a narrow-based stock index
option. Subject to the sixty (60) day holding period, the purchase of such a put
or call option (I.E., a long put or call) is permitted, as is the sale of a call
or the purchase of a put on an individual stock to hedge a long stock position
(I.E., a covered call or put). Special rules under the CGI Policy apply to
options on the stock of Citigroup and its affiliates. This restriction does not
apply to an Independent Director.

               6. No Access Person may purchase or sell a Security if the Access
Person has any material nonpublic information regarding the issuer or an
affiliated issuer.

        F.     LOCATION OF TRADING ACCOUNTS (AND TRANSACTION REPORTING)

               1. Access Persons (other than Independent Directors) generally
are encouraged to maintain their Securities trading accounts at subsidiaries of
Citigroup. However, an Access Person may maintain a trading account elsewhere if
the Access Person gives prior written notice to the Compliance Officer or
designate and the third party specifically agrees to provide the Compliance
Officer with copies of trade confirmations at the same time as they are sent to
the employee. In any event, it is the responsibility of each Access Person
(other than an Independent Director) to instruct their brokers (subsidiaries of
Citigroup or otherwise) to provide the Compliance Officer or designate with
copies of trade confirmations (or, to the extent permitted by the CGI Policy, to
report such person's Securities' transactions to the Compliance Officer or
designate directly on at least a quarterly basis not later than ten days after
the end of the particular calendar quarter).

               2. An Independent Director will be subject to the reporting
provisions of this Code only with respect to transactions by the Independent
Director, directly or indirectly, in
<PAGE>

Securities as to which the Independent Director knows, or in the course of
fulfilling his or her official duties as an Independent Director should know,
that, within the 15-day period before or after the Independent Director's
transaction in such Security, the Company has purchased or sold, or considered
for purchase or sale, such Security. Any such transaction report may include a
statement disclaiming the report as an admission of direct or indirect
"beneficial ownership". In addition, no report is required if effected for an
account over which the Independent Director has no direct or indirect influence
or control, or which is managed on a discretionary basis by a person other than
an the Independent Director and as to which the Independent Director does not in
fact exercise influence or control.

        G.     APPLICABLE ACCOUNTS

        The restrictions in II(A)-(F) above apply to accounts in which an Access
Person, Investment Person, Portfolio Manager and members of their immediate
family have an ownership interest and/or over which they have control.

III.    REPORTING

        Upon employment, each Access Person (other than an Independent Director)
shall provide a listing of all Securities held by or for such person, as well as
the name of any broker or bank with whom the Access Person has an account
holding Securities held by or for such person (as is further described
in the CGI Policy).

IV.     GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

        Access Persons and close family members are not permitted to accept
gifts, loans or preferential treatment from any person doing business with or on
behalf of the Company or its Adviser. This prohibition does not include
occasional business meals which can be reciprocated or gifts of purely nominal
value.
<PAGE>

V.      SERVICE ON BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

        No Access Person (other than an Independent Director) shall serve on the
board of directors of a publicly traded company without compliance with all
applicable Company or CGI policies and the obtaining of all required approvals.

VI.     ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

        Each Access Person must certify in writing on an annual basis that he or
she has received the Company Code, understands its provisions and agrees to be
bound by its terms. Each Access Person must certify annually that he or she has
complied with the requirements of this Code and has disclosed or reported all
personal securities transactions required to be disclosed or reported pursuant
to its requirements.

VII.    SANCTIONS

        Violations of this Code will be scrutinized carefully by the Company.
The penalty for violation can include dismissal from the Company and its
affiliates.
<PAGE>

                                                                      Appendix A


                          CITIGROUP GLOBAL INVESTMENTS

                       PERSONAL SECURITIES TRADING POLICY

                                  JUNE 5, 2002

This Personal Securities Trading Policy (the "Policy" or "Policies") applies to
all U.S. based full and part time personnel of Citigroup Global Investments
("CGI"), including Citigroup Alternative Investments ("CAI"), ("Covered
Persons"). While similar policies apply to employees located overseas, such
local policies may be more or less stringent depending on local requirements and
circumstances. TAMIC and CAI Codes of Ethics that are more restrictive will also
apply to TAMIC "access persons" and all CAI personnel.

The purpose of these Policies is to ensure that securities trading activities by
Covered Persons do not intentionally or inadvertently violate applicable laws
and regulations, do not give even the appearance of inappropriate activity or a
conflict of interest, and do not interfere with investment activities for
corporate or fiduciary portfolios. While these policies are designed to address
both identified and potential conflicts, they cannot possibly be written broadly
enough to cover all potential situations. Covered Persons accordingly are
expected to adhere not only to the letter, but also the spirit, of these
policies.

VIOLATIONS OF THESE POLICIES CAN NOT ONLY CAUSE EMBARRASSMENT, LOSS OF BUSINESS,
FINES AND OTHER LEGAL RESTRICTIONS FOR THE COVERED COMPANIES BUT ALSO CAN LEAD
TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR THE PERSONS INVOLVED. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A
VIOLATION, THE OFFENDING EMPLOYEE WILL RECEIVE A WRITTEN WARNING. THE EMPLOYEE'S
SUPERVISOR WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF THE WARNING. COMPLIANCE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ASSESS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES,
WHICH WOULD INCREASE WITH THE SEVERITY AND/OR FREQUENCY OF THE OFFENSE. THE
ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL PENALTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE PLACEMENT OF
A WRITTEN REPRIMAND IN THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL FILE, THE IMPOSITION OF A FINE,
THE SUSPENSION OF THE RIGHT TO TRADE OR THE SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF
EMPLOYMENT.

These Policies are in addition to other applicable Citigroup policies, including
policies regarding the treatment of material, non-public information. Covered
Persons must never trade in a security or commodity while in possession of
material, non-public information about the issuer or the market for those
securities or commodities, even if the such person has satisfied all other
requirements of these policies.

Information concerning your personal securities transactions will be kept
confidential and used ONLY for purposes of administering the Policy and assuring
compliance with its requirements. As noted above, supervisors and other
appropriate business managers will be informed of violations of these policies.
<PAGE>

If you have any questions regarding the application of the Policy, please
contact your designated compliance officer (the "Compliance Officer") who,
together with the General Counsel, will be responsible for its implementation.

SECURITIES TRADING POLICY
- -------------------------

VIII.   COVERAGE

        A.     COVERED ACCOUNTS

               In the absence of an exception, this Policy applies to
               transactions in securities (as defined below) and related
               financial instruments in "covered accounts." A covered account is
               any account in which a Covered Person has a financial interest or
               has the power, directly or indirectly, to make or influence
               investment decisions. Included within the definition are accounts
               of (i) a Covered Person's spouse or domestic partner; (ii) a
               Covered Person's minor children and any other related individuals
               who reside in the same house with or are financially dependent
               upon the Covered Person; (iii) any other individual to whose
               financial support the Covered Person materially contributes; and
               (iv) any account for which a Covered Person is the trustee or
               fiduciary or has power of attorney.

               A.     EXCLUDED ACCOUNTS

               These policies do not apply to (i) fully discretionary or managed
               accounts with professional money management organizations where
               the Covered Person receives portfolio transaction information not
               more often than monthly*; (ii) estate or trust accounts in which
               a Covered Person has a beneficial interest but no power to affect
               or ability to influence investment decisions, (iii) accounts at
               mutual funds that hold only shares of open-end funds purchased
               directly from that fund company provided that the account does
               not by its terms allow for the execution of securities or
               commodities transactions; (iv) 401(k), 403(b) and Keogh accounts
               where the Covered Person has no power to invest in individual


- ----------
*       Fully discretionary brokerage accounts generally do not qualify for this
        exemption because confirmations are delivered promptly after the
        execution of each transaction. Provided that there is no communication
        between the broker and the covered person regarding investment decisions
        prior to execution, however, these accounts will not be subject to
        preclearance or to the 60 day holding period. Compliance with the other
        rules in Sections IV through including the provision of duplicate trade
        confirmations and account statements, is still required.
<PAGE>

               securities**; (v) CDs, money market, savings or checking accounts
               at banks provided that the account does not by its terms allow
               for the execution of securities or commodities transactions; and
               (v) direct investment programs which allow the purchase of
               securities directly from the issuer without the intermediation of
               a broker-dealer provided that the timing and size of the
               purchases are established by a pre-arranged schedule.

        B.     SECURITIES AND RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

               For purposes of this policy, the term "securities" includes
               stocks, notes, bonds, closed-end mutual funds, options, warrants
               and other derivative securities regardless of whether they are
               private or publicly traded. However, certain financial
               instruments that do not present compliance issues are not
               considered to be "securities" for these purposes and are
               exceptions to this policy. These excluded instruments are U.S.
               government and agency securities, municipal securities,
               short-term money market instruments, certificates of deposit,
               commodities and open-end mutual funds. Futures, options on
               futures and options on broad-based stock indices are also
               excluded, as are trust securities that replicate broad-based
               stock indices.

IX.     BASIC RULES

               B.     No transaction may be completed for a Covered Account if
                      the employee has any material nonpublic information
                      regarding the issuer or an affiliated issuer. Please refer
                      to CGI's Policy on Confidential Information and Chinese
                      Walls for further information about material nonpublic
                      information and your obligations in such a situation.

               C.     No transaction may be completed for a Covered Account in
                      any security that is included on a restricted list to
                      which that Covered Account is subject. In addition, no
                      transaction in any security may be completed for a Covered
                      Account that (i) will violate any applicable laws or
                      regulations,


- ----------
**      The Citigroup 401 (k) plan is not a covered account.
<PAGE>

                      (ii) could give the appearance of inappropriate activity
                      or a conflict of interest, or (iii) could disadvantage or
                      interfere with investing or securities trading activities
                      by firm or customer accounts.

        A.     COVERED PERSONS WHOSE JOB FUNCTIONS RELATE TO PORTFOLIO
               INVESTMENT ARE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING SHORT FOR COVERED ACCOUNTS
               ANY SECURITY OR RELATED CONVERTIBLE SECURITY OWNED BY THE
               PORTFOLIOS FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE. SIMILARLY, BUYING FOR
               COVERED ACCOUNTS ANY SECURITY OR RELATED CONVERTIBLE SECURITY
               SOLD SHORT BY THOSE PORTFOLIOS IS PROHIBITED. COVERED PERSONS ARE
               ALSO PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES TO EFFECT ECONOMICALLY
               EQUIVALENT TRANSACTIONS.

        B.     TRANSACTIONS FOR COVERED ACCOUNTS IN ANY SECURITY AT ANY TIME
               THAT TRANSACTIONS OF ANY SORT IN THE SECURITY OR RELATED
               CONVERTIBLE SECURITY ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR ANY OF THE
               PORTFOLIOS TO WHICH THE COVERED PERSON'S JOB FUNCTION RELATES ARE
               STRONGLY DISCOURAGED. CERTAIN BLACK-OUT PERIODS DURING WHICH
               TRADES IN SUCH SECURITIES ARE PROHIBITED APPLY TO COVERED PERSONS
               WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF SECURITIES
               INVESTMENTS FOR THIRD PARTIES (I.E., CAI AND TAMIC PERSONNEL).
               THOSE BLACK-OUT PERIODS ARE SET FORTH IN SECTION IV.A. OF THIS
               POLICY.

               D.     No short-term transaction in any security may be completed
                      for a Covered Account. Securities may only be purchased
                      for investment purposes, and speculative or excessive
                      trading is discouraged.

        C.     COVERED PERSONS MAY NOT EFFECT THE PURCHASE AND SALE, OR SHORT
               SALE AND COVER, OF THE SAME OR EQUIVALENT SECURITIES WITHIN 60
               CALENDAR DAYS. SECURITIES MAY BE SOLD, OR A SHORT POSITION
               COVERED, ON THE 61ST DAY AFTER THE POSITION WAS ESTABLISHED. A
               HEDGE IS THE ONLY OFFSETTING TRANSACTION THAT MAY BE EFFECTED
               WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED.

        D.     A SHORTER HOLDING PERIOD MAY BE ALLOWED IN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
               TO AVOID PERSONAL HARDSHIP WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OF THE
               COMPLIANCE OFFICER. AN EXCEPTION MAY BE GRANTED WHEN THE VALUE OF
               A COVERED PERSON'S INVESTMENT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED FROM THE
               ORIGINAL ACQUISITION PRICE. HOWEVER, THIS EXCEPTION WILL NOT BE
               GRANTED REPEATEDLY TO PERMIT WHAT AMOUNTS TO SPECULATIVE
               SHORT-TERM TRADING.

        E.     CITIGROUP SECURITIES RECEIVED AS PART OF A COVERED PERSON'S
               COMPENSATION PACKAGE ARE EXEMPT FROM THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD.
               THESE INCLUDE CAP SHARES THAT HAVE VESTED AND SHARES RECEIVED
               UPON THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS WHOSE RESALE RESTRICTIONS HAVE
               EXPIRED. EXERCISES AND RELOADS OF CITIGROUP STOCK OPTIONS ARE
               ALSO EXEMPT FROM THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD.
<PAGE>

               E.     Subject to the limitations set forth below, Covered
                      Persons may buy or sell derivative instruments such as
                      individual stock options, options and futures on stock
                      indexes and options and futures on fixed income
                      securities. Except as otherwise provided herein, these
                      transactions must comply with the preclearance, 60-day
                      holding period and other restrictions of the Policy.

        F.     SUBJECT TO THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD, COVERED PERSONS MAY HEDGE A
               LONG STOCK POSITION BY SELLING CALLS OR PURCHASING PUTS ON THAT
               STOCK OR MAY HEDGE A SHORT STOCK POSITION BY PURCHASING CALLS ON
               THAT STOCK. HOWEVER, THE 60-DAY HOLDING PERIOD DOES NOT APPLY TO
               INDIVIDUAL STOCK OPTIONS THAT ARE PART OF A HEDGED POSITION WHERE
               THE UNDERLYING STOCK HAS BEEN HELD FOR MORE THAN 60 DAYS AND THE
               ENTIRE POSITION (INCLUDING THE UNDERLYING SECURITY) IS CLOSED
               OUT.

        G.     COVERED PERSONS MAY BUY A CALL OPTION, BUY A PUT OPTION OR SELL A
               PUT OPTION ON A STOCK SUCH PERSONS DO NOT OWN, BUT MAY NOT SELL A
               CALL OPTION WITHOUT OWNING THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. IN
               ADDITION, COVERED PERSONS MAY NOT EFFECT A SHORT SALE OF A
               NARROW-BASED STOCK INDEX OPTION. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO OPTIONS
               ON COMMON STOCK OTHER THAN CITIGROUP, WHICH IS GOVERNED BY
               SPECIAL RULES.

               F.     The Compliance Officer may grant discretionary exceptions
                      on a case-by-case basis to the general pre-clearance rule,
                      the 60-day holding period or to other elements of this
                      Policy if appropriate under the circumstances. Requests
                      for and approvals of exceptions MUST be in writing. An
                      approval must be received before it may be acted on.

X.      PRECLEARANCE RULE

        A.     GENERAL RULE

        A.     ABSENT AN EXCEPTION, EACH TRANSACTION IN ANY SECURITY MUST
               RECEIVE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND BE
               COMPLETED ON THE SAME DAY THAT APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED.

        B.     IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A PRECLEARANCE, THE COVERED PERSON MUST FILL
               OUT THE TRADING CLEARANCE FORM, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS
               EXHIBIT A AND SUBMIT
<PAGE>

               IT TO THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER, WHO WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS
               PROMPTLY AS PRACTICABLE (USUALLY WITHIN ONE HOUR).

        C.     THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE COVERED PERSON MUST INCLUDE ANY
               POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS TOGETHER WITH WRITTEN
               CERTIFICATION THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH THE
               ABILITY OF THE FIRM AND CUSTOMERS TO TRANSACT IN THE SECURITY.

        B.     EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRECLEARANCE RULE

               There are several automatic exceptions to the general
               preclearance rule for which a separate written exception from the
               Compliance Officer is not necessary. However, compliance with the
               other rules in Sections IV through VI below is still required.
               These automatic exceptions cover the following transactions:

        A.     TRANSACTIONS IN CLOSED-END MUTUAL FUNDS.

        B.     TRANSACTIONS IN COMPANY-SPONSORED STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS, RIGHTS
               OFFERINGS AND INVOLUNTARY SITUATIONS (SUCH AS TENDERING INTO A
               MERGER).

        C.     MUNICIPAL SECURITIES. (NOTE: CAI and TAMIC personnel are required
               to preclear transactions in municipal securities to comply with
               their Codes of Ethics.)

        D.     ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE TERM "SECURITIES" IN
               SECTION 1C ABOVE.

XI.     OTHER RULES

        A.     BLACK-OUT PERIODS

               Certain black-out periods apply to Covered Persons whose business
               units manage securities investments for third parties (I.E., CAI
               and TAMIC personnel). For one business day before or after a day
               on which a third party account managed by a Covered Person's unit
               buys or sells a security, no Covered Person employed by that unit
               may buy or sell the security (or a related security). For seven
               (7) calendar days before or after a day on which a third party
               account buys or sells a security, no Covered Person who is a
               portfolio manager for the account may purchase or sell the
               security (or a related security). Any profits realized on such a
               trade must be disgorged. Municipal securities are covered by this
               blackout requirement. Notwithstanding this general blackout
               requirement, transactions exempt from preclearance under this
               Policy also are exempt from this blackout requirement.
<PAGE>

        B.     INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS

        A.     COVERED EMPLOYEES MAY NOT PURCHASE EQUITY SECURITIES IN AN
               INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

        C.     PRIVATE EQUITY/ LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS/ HEDGE FUNDS

        A.     INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY (BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY
               THROUGH FUNDS), LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND HEDGE FUNDS BY COVERED
               PERSONS OF CGI REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM BOTH THE COVERED PERSONS'
               BUSINESS HEAD AND CGI COMPLIANCE.

XII.    REPORTING PROCESS

        A.     COVERED PERSONS MUST CERTIFY IN WRITING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A
               COPY OF THIS POLICY AND HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ITS PROVISIONS.
               THE FORM OF CERTIFICATION, WHICH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND
               RETURN, IS ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT B.

        B.     COVERED PERSONS ARE GENERALLY ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN THEIR
               SECURITIES TRADING ACCOUNTS AT SUBSIDIARIES OF CITIGROUP. COVERED
               PERSONS MAY, HOWEVER, MAINTAIN COVERED ACCOUNTS ELSEWHERE. NEW
               EMPLOYEES MUST WITHIN 10 DAYS OF REPORTING FOR DUTY COMPLETE THE
               FORM ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT C TO REPORT ALL COVERED ACCOUNTS, AND

XIII.   TRANSACTIONS IN CITIGROUP SECURITIES

               Unless a Covered Person is a member of a designated group subject
               to more restrictive provisions, or is otherwise notified to the
               contrary, the Covered Person may trade in Citigroup securities
               without restriction (other than the pre-clearance and
<PAGE>

               other requirements of this policy), subject to the limitations
               set forth below.

               G.     Covered Employees may not engage in any transactions in
                      Citigroup securities during the "blackout periods"
                      beginning on the first day of a calendar quarter and
                      ending 24 hours following release of Citigroup's earnings
                      for the prior quarter. Citigroup stock option exercises,
                      including cash purchase, swap and reload exercises, are
                      permitted during a blackout period, but exercises which
                      involve the simultaneous sale of the underlying Citigroup
                      common stock (I.E., same-day-sale or sell-to-cover
                      exercises) are prohibited. With regard to exchange-traded
                      options, no transactions in Citigroup options are
                      permitted except to close or roll an option position that
                      expires during a blackout period. Charitable contributions
                      of Citigroup securities may be made during the blackout
                      period, but a private foundation controlled by a Covered
                      Employee may not sell donated Citigroup common stock
                      during the blackout period.

               H.     No Covered Person may engage at any time in any personal
                      transaction in Citigroup securities while in possession of
                      material non-public information relating to Citigroup or
                      its securities. Investments in Citigroup securities must
                      be made with a long-term orientation rather than for
                      speculation or for the generation of short-term trading
                      profits, and must be held for at least 60 days. In
                      addition, please note that Covered Persons MAY NOT ENGAGE
                      in any of the following transactions in Citigroup
                      securities:

        A.     SHORT SALES, OTHER THAN SHORTS AGAINST THE BOX;
<PAGE>

        B.     SALES OF PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, OTHER THAN SELLING A CALL TO HEDGE
               A LONG POSITION IN DELIVERABLE CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK;

        C.     PURCHASES OF PUTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES (PUTS MAY BE PURCHASED
               TO HEDGE A LONG POSITION IN DELIVERABLE CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK);

        D.     SPECULATIVE OPTION STRATEGIES (I.E., STRADDLES, COMBINATIONS,
               SPREADS);

        E.     ANY TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE HEDGING OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED
               STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM ("CAP").

               I.  The number of Citigroup shares that a Covered Person is
                   entitled to in the Citigroup Stock Purchase Plan is not
                   treated as a long stock position until such time as the
                   Covered Person has given instructions to purchase the shares
                   of Citigroup. Thus, Covered Persons are not permitted to use
                   options to hedge their financial interest in the Citigroup
                   Stock Purchase Plan.

               J.  Contributions into and transfers within the firm's 401(k)
                   Plan are not subject to the restrictions and prohibitions
                   (including preclearance) set forth in this policy.
