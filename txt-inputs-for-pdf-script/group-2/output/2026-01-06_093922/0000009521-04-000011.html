BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND

To Our Shareholders

The economic expansion continues to develop as non-farm payrolls have increased
by over one million in 2004.  As usually occurs in such expansions, interest
rates have gone up.  Over the past six months interest rates have gone from
approximately 3% to 4% on five year U.S. Treasury bonds, from 4.3% to 5% on five
year BBB (investment  grade) bonds and from 6.9% to 7.5% on five year B
industrial bonds.  Other maturities have seen similar rises in rates.  So, even
though the Federal Reserve Board has not raised rates yet, the bond market has.

Oil prices appear to have topped out for now, but we expect they may remain in a
range of $35-$40 per barrel rather than the old expectation of $22-$28 per
barrel.  Further, gasoline prices should remain high as the refineries that make
gasoline for our cars and trucks are capacity-constrained.  No new refinery has
been built in the U.S. since 1976 and we have only half of the refineries we had
in 1981.

The combination of higher interest rates and higher energy prices leads us to
believe that economic growth will be a bit slower than the 4% we expected, but
we still expect growth around 3.5% in 2004 and 2005.

From Bancroft Convertible Fund&#x27;s founding in 1971, the Fund&#x27;s strategy has been
to use convertible securities as an equity alternative to reduce risk and
volatility.  This strategy tends to outperform in bear markets and lag in bull
markets.  The net asset value of the Fund has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 stock
index for the five years ended April 30, 2004 and underperformed for the one
year ended April 30, 2004.  The nature of the Fund&#x27;s convertible securities
investments explains much of this difference in performance during these
periods.  The Fund&#x27;s NAV slightly underperformed the average of its peer-group
for the four months ended April 30, 2004.  Our peers consist of the thirteen
closed-end convertible funds in the Lipper Closed-End Performance Analysis, but
of these thirteen only four of these, including Bancroft, remain unleveraged
convertible funds with greater than 80% of their investments in convertible
securities.  The addition of leverage usually makes portfolios more volatile and
the addition of non-convertible debt increases exposure to interest rate risk.

The results of the 2004 annual shareholders&#x27; meeting are shown in the
Miscellaneous Notes section of this report.  We thank you for your participation
and support.  Additional information on the Fund is available on the Fund&#x27;s
website (www.bancroftfund.com).  Further, shareholders who wish to obtain a copy

BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND

Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited)

1.  Significant Accounting Policies
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the &quot;Fund&quot;) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements:

(a)  Security Valuation
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at
market using the last reported sales price as of the close of regular trading.
Unlisted securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities
for which no sales were reported, are valued at the mean between closing
reported bid and asked prices as of the close of regular trading. Securities for
which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities and other
assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management with
the approval of the Board of Directors. Short-term debt securities with initial
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

(b)  Securities Transactions and Related Investment Income
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy
or sell is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being
determined based upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including
accretion of discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain
securities, known as &quot;contingent payment debt instruments,&quot; Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to record non-cash, &quot;contingent&quot; interest income in
addition to interest income actually received. Contingent interest income
amounted to 5 cents per share for the six months ended April 30, 2004.

(c)  Federal Income Taxes
It is the policy of the Fund to distribute substantially all of its taxable
income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies.
Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is believed
necessary. At October 31, 2003, the net capital loss carryforward of the Fund
which may be used to offset possible future net realized gains was approximately
$8,230,848, and expires in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
</pre><div class="pagebreak"></div><pre class="filing">(d)  Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders
The liability for dividends and distributions payable is recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

(e)  Market Risk
It is the Fund&#x27;s policy, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of
its assets in convertible securities. Although convertible securities do derive
part of their value from that of the securities into which they are convertible,
they are not considered derivative financial instruments. However, certain of
the Fund&#x27;s investments include features which render them more sensitive to
price changes in their underlying securities. Thus they expose the Fund to
greater downside risk than traditional convertible securities, but still less
than that of the underlying common stock. At April 30, 2004, the market value of
those securities was $24,955,866, representing 21.6% of net assets.

2.  Management Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
The management fee is paid to the investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore Management
Company (the &quot;Adviser&quot;). The contract provides for payment of a monthly advisory
fee, computed at an annual rate of 3/4 of 1% of the first $100,000,000 and 1/2
of 1% of the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund&#x27;s net asset value in such
month.

The Adviser invests the Fund&#x27;s assets, furnishes office equipment and
facilities, and pays the salaries of all executive officers of the Fund, except
that the costs associated with personnel and certain non-personnel expenses of
the office of the Treasurer up to a maximum of $25,000 a year are reimbursed by
the Fund. Such reimbursements amounted to $12,500 for the six months ended April
30, 2004. The officers of the Fund are also directors, officers or employees of
the Adviser, and are compensated by the Adviser.

3.  Portfolio Activity
At April 30, 2004 there were 5,557,138 shares of $.01 par value common stock
outstanding (9,000,000 shares authorized). During the six months ended April 30,
2004, 33,362 shares were issued in connection with reinvestment of dividends
from net investment income, resulting in an increase in paid-in capital of
$628,542.

On December 16, 2003, the Fund completed a rights offering of Common Stock to
its stockholders at the rate of one common share for each 6 rights held by
stockholders of record on November 13, 2003. The rights offering was fully
subscribed, resulting in the issuance of 797,918 common shares at a price of
$17.82, and proceeds of $14,218,899 to the Fund prior to the deduction of
expenses. The net asset value per share of the Fund&#x27;s Common Stock was reduced
by approximately $0.50 per share as a result of the issuance.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $58,698,124 and $48,431,018, respectively, for the six months ended

The registrant adopted Shareholder Communication Procedures (the &quot;Procedures&quot;)

by which shareholders of the registrant may send communications to the Board.
If a shareholder sends a recommendation of a nominee to the Board or to an
individual director, such communication would be covered by the Procedures.
Shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;), and communications made in
connection with such proposals are not subject to the Procedures.  The
Registrant&#x27;s Bylaws also contain provisions requiring a shareholder to provide
advance notice of his or her intention to nominate, at the Registrant&#x27;s annual
meeting of shareholders, an individual for election as director.

Pursuant to the Procedures, shareholders should send their communications to the
Shareholder Relations Group.  Communications may be sent by regular mail or
delivery service to the following address: 65 Madison Avenue, Suite 550,
Morristown, NJ 07960.  E mail communications may be sent to:
info@bancroftfund.com.  All shareholder communications received by the

director of the registrant to whom they were addressed or to the full Board, as
applicable.  Copies of all such shareholder communications will also be
distributed to the Chairs of each of the registrant&#x27;s Audit Committee, and
Nominating and Administration Committee, and to counsel for the registrant and
for the independent directors.  Counsel for the registrant and for the
independent directors, upon receipt of its copy of a shareholder communication,
shall work with such Chairs and counsel for the independent directors to
determine whether such shareholder communication should be distributed to any
directors to whom it was not sent and whether and in what manner the directors
should respond to such shareholder communication.  Responses, if any, to
shareholder communications shall be coordinated by counsel for the registrant
and for the independent directors, working with the Chairs.

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of May 26, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of the officers of Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the
&quot;Registrant&quot;), including the Principal Executive Officer (&quot;PEO&quot;) and Principal
Financial Officer (&quot;PFO&quot;), to assess the effectiveness of the Registrant&#x27;s
disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 30a-3(c)
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;Act&quot;), as amended. Based on that
evaluation, the Registrant&#x27;s officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded
that, as of May 26, 2004, the Registrant&#x27;s disclosure controls and procedures
were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information required to be
disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information relating
to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no significant changes in the Registrant&#x27;s internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the Registrant&#x27;s last fiscal half-
year (the Registrant&#x27;s second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Registrant&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting.
