Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") operates as a closed-end,
diversified management investment company and invests primarily in convertible
securities, with the objectives of providing income and the potential for
capital appreciation -- which objectives the Fund considers to be relatively
equal, over the long-term, due to the nature of the securities in which it
invests.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
  With the passage of a stimulative tax cut package and the upward movement
of the stock market the economic slowdown of the past few years should be
coming to an end. The decline in stock prices that began in March 2000 took the
S&P 500 Index which was over 1500, to under 800 three times, the last in March
2003. Since then, the S&P 500 has moved up to near 1000. Historically,
advances of this magnitude (roughly 25%) signal that a pick up in economic
activity is near. If indeed the economy picks up as we expect, then the growth
that should occur in corporate earnings should help the stock market to advance
further. This may also signal the end of the rise in bond prices that we have
seen since January 2000.
  Current economic conditions have affected the convertible securities
markets. The low interest rate environment has reduced the rates paid on new
issues of convertibles and, generally, the convertible market has become more
interest rate sensitive and less equity sensitive. Since we believe that there
is a significant probability of an interest rate rise as economic activity
picks up, we have sought to reduce interest rate risk by buying convertibles
that have relatively short maturities or that have "put" features that allow us
to sell the bonds back to the issuer at a set price. We have also sought to
increase the equity sensitivity of the portfolio by purchasing convertible
issues known as "mandatories." These issues automatically convert to common
stock upon maturity.
  A basic premise under which the Fund operates is that convertible
securities can offer equity-like performance with less volatility over complete
market cycles.  As indicated on the chart on the facing Highlights page, the
Fund's net asset and market values outperformed the Closed-end Convertible Fund
average and the Russell 2000 Index for the one year, five year and ten year
periods ended April 30, 2003. The Fund also outperformed the S&P 500 Index for
the one year and five year periods ended April 30, 2003. We believe that past
outperformance of these important indices and of our peer category, while no
guarantee of future returns, is an historical validation of this premise.
  The Fund's website (www.bancroftfund.com) contains press releases,
dividend information and daily net asset values.  The Closed-End Fund
Association (www.cefa.com), of which the Fund is a member, is another source of
information on many closed-end funds.* Based upon data through May 31, 2003,
Morningstar ** has continued to rate the Fund's performance at four stars
(above average) overall as measured on the "Quicktake Report" on their website.
In addition, shareholders who wish to obtain a copy of the most recent report
on the Fund issued by Standard and Poor's should contact us.
  The results of the 2003 annual shareholders' meeting are shown in the
Miscellaneous Notes section of this report. Thank you for your support.
  At its May meeting the Board of Directors declared a dividend of 16 cents
per share.  The dividend consists of undistributed net investment income. This
dividend will be payable on June 27, 2003 to shareholders of record on June 13,
2003.

Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited)
1.  Significant Accounting Policies
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its
financial statements:

(a)  Security Valuation
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange
are valued at market using the last reported sales price as of the
close of regular trading. Securities traded in the over-the-counter
market and listed securities for which no sales were reported are
valued at the mean between reported bid and asked prices as of the
close of regular trading. Where no closing prices are available,
value is determined by management, with the approval of the Board
of Directors.

(b)  Securities Transactions and Related Investment Income
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the
order to buy or sell is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of
securities being determined based upon identified cost. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis, including accretion of discounts and
amortization of non-equity premium. For certain securities, known
as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax regulations
require the Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income
in addition to interest income actually received. Contingent
interest income amounted to 4 cents per share for the six months
ended April 30, 2003.

(c)  Federal Income Taxes
It is the policy of the Fund to distribute substantially all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply
with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
regulated investment companies. Therefore, no provision for federal
income or excise taxes is believed necessary. The Fund has capital
loss carryovers of approximately $2,328,000 and $5,478,000 available
to offset any future net capital gains which will expire on
October 31, 2009 and October 31, 2010, respectively.

(d)  Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders
The liability for dividends and distributions payable is recorded
on the ex-dividend date.

<PAGE> 14
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
(e)  Market Risk
It is the Fund's policy, under normal circumstances, to invest at
least 80% of its assets in convertible securities. Although
convertible securities do derive part of their value from that of
the securities into which they are convertible, they are not
considered derivative financial instruments. However, certain of the
Fund's investments, known as Mandatory Convertible Securities, include
features which render them more sensitive to price changes in their
underlying securities. Thus they expose the Fund to greater downside
risk than traditional convertible securities, but still less than that
of the underlying common stock. At April 30, 2003, the market value of
such securities was $15,646,375, representing 17% of net assets.

2.  Management Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
The management fee is paid to the investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company (the "Adviser").  The contract provides for payment
of a monthly advisory fee, computed at an annual rate of 3/4 of 1% of
the first $100,000,000 and 1/2 of 1% of the excess over $100,000,000 of
the Fund's net asset value in such month.

The Adviser invests the Fund's asets, furnishes office equipment and
facilities, and pays the salaries of all executive officers of the
Fund, except that the costs associated with personnel and certain non-
personnel expenses of the office of the Treasurer, up to a maximum of
$25,000 a year, are reimbursed by the Fund.  Such reimbursements
amounted to $12,500 for the six months ended April 30, 2003. The
officers of the Fund are also directors, officers or employees of the
Adviser, and are compensated by the Adviser.

3.  Portfolio Activity
At April 30, 2003 there were 4,725,858 shares of $.01 par value
common stock outstanding, (9,000,000 shares authorized). During the
six months ended April 30, 2003, 41,388 shares were issued in connection
with reinvestment of dividends from net investment income, resulting in
an increase in paid-in capital of $742,900.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term
notes, aggregated $31,909,111 and $37,970,671, respectively, for the
six months ended April 30, 2003.

A distribution of $0.16 per share from net investment income was
declared on May 15, 2003, payable June 27, 2003 to shareholders of
record at the close of business June 13, 2003.
