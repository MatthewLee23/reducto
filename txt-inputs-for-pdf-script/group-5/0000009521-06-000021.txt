To Our Shareholders ------------------------------------------------------------

December 7, 2006

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Bancroft has declared a
dividend of $0.731 per share which includes a $0.466 distribution of realized
long-term capital gains.  The Fund's largest realized gains came from its
investments in Amerada Hess, Valero, Maverick Tube and The Williams Companies.
Our largest gains were in energy related issues while our largest losses were in
some banking and pharmaceutical convertibles.  The gains realized this year were
larger than both the loss carryforward from prior years and the losses taken in
the rest of the portfolio.

The convertible market in calendar 2006 has seen substantial activity as
Citigroup Investment Research reports that there have been $58 billion of new
domestic convertibles issued, putting the convertible market on track to
exceed $60 billion for the first time since 2003.  This has been roughly enough
to keep up with the redemptions of convertibles this year.

We continue to see a decline in the average yield as Citigroup has measured the
average current yield at 3.1%, down from 3.7% a year ago.  Offsetting this
decline in yield is a drop in the average conversion premium to 26.8% from
31.3% a year ago.  These changes make the average convertible somewhat more
equity sensitive and more volatile than they were a year ago.  While we
continue to see attractive opportunities in this market, the average
convertible appears to be at a modest premium to some measures of theoretical
value.  This leads us to the conclusion that convertibles as a group appear to
be fairly valued and opportunities are more likely to be found in
individual convertible issues with compelling underlying stocks.

As noted above, the Fund made profits from its energy holdings.  These holdings
have been less profitable since early summer but we still believe that energy
is attractive due to our expectation of global economic growth.  The Fund's
exposure to telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and banking has been
helpful of late.  On the other hand, performance has been hurt by our exposure
to aerospace and defense.

As seen in the Highlights section of this report, we have added a new column
which reflects the ten year volatility (as measured by the standard deviation)
of the various performance figures.  Many market professionals consider the
volatility of past returns to be a useful approximation of the past levels of
risk in the Fund.  A higher volatility level equates to a higher measure of
risk.  This measure of historic results may not reflect future performance but
we believe that it is informative.  We have also added the Merrill Lynch All
Convertibles Index, a market-weighted index consisting of every domestic
security in the convertibles universe rated B- or higher, and with a market
value of more than $50 million at the time of inclusion.  We believe this index
provides a useful comparison to the Fund's performance since over the past five
years, while the Fund has remained predominately invested in
convertibles, many of our peers have migrated away from such a predominance to
a mixture of convertibles and non-convertibles.

The Fund's performance through fiscal 2006 reflects the style of convertible
investing intended to produce growth and income with reduced volatility.
While total return has lagged the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index, the
volatility of those returns, over ten years, is lower for the Fund than for the
index.

To Our Shareholders (continued)-------------------------------------------------

On December 31, 2006 boardmember Donald M. Halsted, Jr. will retire.  He has
served with distinction on the board of Bancroft for over thirty-five years.
Throughout, Don has been a strong supporter of the diversified portfolio of
convertibles concept.  He has been indispensable and his contributions to the
Fund's governance are too many to recount here, having served on both the Audit
and Governance Committees. We will miss his presence.

Visit our website, www.bancroftfund.com, for additional information such as a
monthly portfolio summary which lists the Fund's largest holdings.  Quarterly
updates may be found in the Financial Reports section, and other financial data
is included in press releases.  We have also added the Fund's Audit and
Governance Committee charters to the website.

On November 20, 2006, the Board of Trustees declared (1) a dividend of $0.265
per share from undistributed net investment income and (2) a distribution of
$0.466 per share from undistributed net long-term capital gains, both payable
December 26, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business December
1, 2006.


The 2007 annual meeting of shareholders will be held on February 12, 2007.
Time and location will be included in the proxy statement, scheduled to be
mailed to shareholders on December 26, 2006.  All shareholders are welcome to
attend, we hope to see you there.

Notes to Financial Statements---------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)Organization -- Bancroft Fund Ltd. (successor to Bancroft Convertible Fund,
Inc. (established in 1971)) (the "Fund"), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
On March 17, 2006, the Fund was reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust from a
Delaware corporation.

(b) Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

(c) Indemnification -- Under the Fund's organizational documents, each trustee,
officer or other agent of the Fund (including the Fund's investment adviser) is
indemnified against certain liabilities that may arise out of performance of
their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification clauses.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet
occurred. The risk of material loss as a result of such indemnification is
considered remote.

(d) Federal Income Taxes -- The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all
of its taxable income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
believed necessary. At October 31, 2006, the Fund utilized capital loss
carryforward of $4,596,296 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset
net capital gains. As of October 31, 2006, the Fund had no capital loss
carryforwards.

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Fund's tax return to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. Management has not completed
their analysis on whether the adoption of FIN 48 will have an impact on the
financial statements.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(e) Security Valuation - Investments in securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at market using the last reported sales
price as of the close of regular trading.   Listed securities for which no
sales were reported, are valued at the mean between closing reported bid and
asked prices as of the close of regular trading.  Unlisted securities traded in
the over-the-counter market are valued using an evaluated quote provided by an
independent pricing service. The independent pricing service derives an
evaluated quote by obtaining dealer quotes, analyzing the listed markets,
reviewing trade execution data and employing sensitivity analysis. Evaluated
quotes may also reflect appropriate factors such as individual characteristics
of the issue, communications with broker-dealers, and other market data.
Securities for which quotations are not readily available, restricted
securities and other assets are valued at fair value as determined
in good faith by management pursuant to procedures approved by the
Board of Trustees.  Short-term debt securities with original maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost.

(f) Securities Transactions and Related Investment Income - Security
transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell
is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being determined based
upon identified cost.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain securities, known
as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax regulations require the
Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in addition to interest
income actually received. Contingent interest income amounted to 13 cents per
share for the year ended October 31, 2006.  In addition, Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on contingent payment
debt instruments to interest income.  At October 31, 2006 there were unrealized
losses of approximately 8 cents per share on contingent payment debt
instruments.

(g) Change in Method of Accounting - Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began
amortizing discounts and premiums on all debt securities. Prior to November 1,
2004, the Fund amortized discounts on original issue discount debt securities.
The new method of amortization was adopted in accordance with the provisions of
the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies and the
financial highlights and statement of changes in net assets presented herein
have been restated to reflect the new method retroactive to November 1, 2001.
The effect of this accounting change is included in the financial highlights for
the years ended October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  The cumulative effect of this
accounting change had no impact on the total net assets of the Fund or on
distributions for tax purposes, but resulted in a $103,986 increase in the cost
of securities held and a corresponding $103,986 reduction in the net unrealized
gains based on the securities held on November 1, 2001.  These changes had no
effect on previously reported total net assets or total returns.

(h) Distributions to Shareholders - Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date
and paid annually.  The amount and character of income and capital gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005 were
$4,395,566 and $3,894,853, respectively, both from ordinary income.

At October 31, 2006 the components of distributable net assets and federal tax
cost were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation                  	      $  9,273,673
Unrealized depreciation                           (3,829,223)
                                                ------------
Net unrealized appreciation                        5,444,450
Undistributed ordinary income                      1,480,740
Undistributed capital gains                        2,615,450
                                                ------------
Total distributable net assets                  $  9,540,640
                                                ============

Cost for federal income tax purposes            $121,254,223

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(i) Market Risk - It is the Fund's policy to invest at least 65% of its assets
(consisting of net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
purposes) in convertible securities.  Although convertible securities do derive
part of their value from that of the securities into which they are convertible,
they are not considered derivative financial instruments.  However, certain of
the Fund's investments include features which render them more sensitive to
price changes of their underlying securities.  Thus they expose the Fund to
greater downside risk than traditional convertible securities, but generally
less than that of the underlying common stock.  The market value of those
securities was $21,822,808 at October 31, 2006, representing 17.2% of net
assets.

(j) New Accounting Pronouncements - In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements."  This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards.  SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years.  The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded
disclosures about fair value measurements.  As of October 31, 2006, the Fund
does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial
statement amounts, however, additional disclosures may be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the
measurements on changes in net assets for the period.

NOTE 2 - MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore"). Pursuant to the investment advisory
agreement, Davis-Dinsmore provides the Fund with investment advice, office
space and facilities.  Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement,
the Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month an advisory fee for
such month computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the first $100,000,000 and
0.50% of the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such
month.

The Fund, pursuant to an administrative services agreement with Davis-Dinsmore,
has agreed to pay Davis-Dinsmore for certain accounting and other administrative
services provided to the Fund.  Under the administrative services agreement, the
Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore compensation in the amount of $25,000 per year, payable
on a monthly basis.  Effective January 1, 2007, the Fund will pay Davis-Dinsmore
on the last day of each month a fee for such month computed at an annual rate of
0.05% of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are officers and directors of Davis-
Dinsmore.

NOTE 3 - PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

At October 31, 2006 there were 5,625,134 shares of beneficial interest
outstanding, with a par value of $0.01 per share.  During the years ended
October 31, 2006 and 2005, 36,681 shares and 31,315 shares were issued in
connection with reinvestment of dividends from net investment income, resulting
in an increase in paid-in capital of $655,492 and $582,476, respectively.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $67,500,867 and $68,023,810, respectively, for the year ended
October 31, 2006.

A distribution of $0.731 per share, consisting of $0.265 from net investment
income, and $0.466 long-term capital gains was declared on November 20, 2006,
payable December 26, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business
December 1, 2006.

Report of Independent Registered------------------------------------------------
Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of
  Bancroft Fund Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments of Bancroft Fund Ltd. (formerly Bancroft
Convertible Fund, Inc.) (the "Fund") as of October 31, 2006, and the related
statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the two years in the period then ended.  These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.  The financial
highlights for each of the years in the three year period ended October 31, 2004
have been audited by other auditors, whose report dated November 19, 2004
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform
an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.   An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2006,
by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, or by other appropriate
auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Bancroft Fund Ltd. as of October 31, 2006, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets and its financial highlights
for each of the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Miscellaneous Notes-------------------------------------------------------------

Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Payment Plan

The Fund has an Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Payment Plan (the
"Plan").  Any shareholder may elect to join the Plan by sending an application
to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, P.O. Box 922, Church Street
Station, NY 10269-0560 (the "Plan Agent").  You may also obtain additional
information about the Plan as well as the Plan application by calling the Plan
Agent toll free at (800) 937-5449.  If your shares are held by a broker or
other nominee, you should instruct the nominee to join the Plan on your behalf.
Some brokers may require that your shares be taken out of the broker's "street
name" and re-registered in your own name.  Shareholders should also contact
their broker to determine whether shares acquired through participation in the
Plan can be transferred to another broker, and thereafter, whether the
shareholder can continue to participate in the Plan.

Under the Plan, all dividends and distributions are automatically invested in
additional Fund shares.  Depending on the circumstances, shares may either be
issued by the Fund or acquired through open market purchases at the current
market price or net asset value, whichever is lower (but not less than 95% of
market price).  When the market price is lower, the Plan Agent will combine
your dividends with those of other Plan participants and purchase shares in the
market, thereby taking advantage of the lower commissions on larger purchases.
There is no other charge for this service.

All dividends and distributions made by the Fund (including capital gain
dividends and dividends designated as qualified dividend income, which are
eligible for taxation at lower rates) remain taxable to Plan participants,
regardless of whether such dividends and distributions are reinvested in
additional shares of the Fund through open market purchases or through the
issuance of new shares.  Plan participants will be treated as receiving the
cash used to purchase shares on the open market and, in the case of any
dividend or distribution made in the form of newly issued shares, will be
treated as receiving an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares as
of the reinvestment date.  Accordingly, a shareholder may incur a tax liability
even though such shareholder has not received a cash distribution with which to
pay the tax.

Plan participants may also voluntarily send cash payments of $100 to $10,000
per month to the Plan Agent, to be combined with other Plan monies, for
purchase of additional Fund shares in the open  market.  You pay only a bank
service charge of $1.25 per transaction, plus your proportionate share of the
brokerage commission.  All shares and fractional shares purchased will be held
by the Plan Agent in your dividend reinvestment account.  You may deposit with
the Plan Agent any Bancroft share certificates you hold, for a one-time fee
of $7.50.

At any time, a Plan participant may instruct the Plan Agent to liquidate all or
any portion of such Plan participant's account.  To do so, a Plan participant
must deliver written notice to the Plan Agent prior to the record date of any
dividend or distribution requesting either liquidation or a share certificate.
The Plan Agent will combine all liquidation requests it receives from Plan
participants on a particular day and will then sell shares of the Fund that are
subject to liquidation requests in the open market.  The amount of proceeds a
Plan participant will receive shall be determined by the average sales price
per share, after deducting brokerage commissions, of all shares sold by the
Plan Agent for all Plan participants who have given the Plan Agent
liquidation requests.

The Plan Agent or the Fund may terminate the Plan for any reason at any time by
sending written notice addressed to Plan participant's address as shown on the
Plan Agent's records.  Following the date of termination, the Plan Agent shall
send the Plan participant either the proceeds of liquidation, or a share
certificate or certificates for the full shares held by the Plan Agent in the
Plan participant's account.  Additionally, a check will be sent for the value
of any fractional interest in the Plan participant's account based on the
market price of the Fund's shares on that date.

Change in Investment Policies
The Fund currently has a non-fundamental investment objective of investing
primarily in convertible securities with the objectives of providing income and
the potential for capital appreciation (which objectives the Fund considers to
be relatively equal due to the nature of the securities in which it invests).

The Board has approved the following new investment policy for the Fund: The
Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 65% of the value of its
assets (consisting of net assets plus the amount of any borrowing for investment
purposes) in convertible securities.

The Board has eliminated the following non-fundamental policy: The Fund will
invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its assets
(consisting of net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
purposes) in convertible securities.

These changes became effective as of September 29, 2006.  Fund shareholders
were provided 60 days notice of these changes in July 2006.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For More Information About Portfolio Holdings
In addition to the semi-annual and annual reports that Bancroft delivers to
shareholders and makes available through the Fund's public website, the Fund
files a complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) for the Fund's first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q.
Bancroft does not deliver the schedule of portfolio holdings for the first and
third fiscal quarters to shareholders, however the schedule is posted to the
Fund's public website, www.bancroftfund.com. You may obtain the Form N-Q
filings by accessing the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  You may also review and

Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings to Broker-Dealers
From time to time, brokers with whom the Fund's Adviser, Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company, has a pre-existing relationship may request that Davis-
Dinsmore disclose Fund portfolio holdings to such broker in advance of the
public disclosure of such portfolio holdings.  Davis-Dinsmore may make such
disclosure under the following conditions: (i) the specific purpose of the
disclosure is to assist Davis-Dinsmore in identifying potential investment
opportunities for the Fund; (ii) prior to the receipt of nonpublic portfolio
holdings, the broker, by means of email or other written communication, shall
agree to keep the nonpublic portfolio holdings confidential and not to use the
information for the broker's own benefit, except in connection with the above
described purpose for which it was disclosed; (iii) Davis-Dinsmore shall keep
written records of its agreement with each broker to which it distributes
nonpublic portfolio holdings; and (iv) Davis-Dinsmore will secure a new
agreement with a broker any time the broker directs the nonpublic portfolio
holdings to be sent to a new recipient.

Dinsmore) is the Fund's investment adviser and is also the investment adviser to
Ellsworth. Because of this connection, the Fund and Ellsworth make up a Fund
Complex. Therefore, each trustee oversees two investment companies in the Fund
Complex.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund has adopted a code of ethics that applies to
the Fund's principal executive officer and principal financial officer. See
attached Exhibit EX-99.CODE ETH.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The Board of Trustees determined that Trustee Robert J. McMullan, who is
"independent" as such term is used in Form N-CSR, possesses the attributes
required to be considered an audit committee financial expert under applicable
federal securities laws.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

Set forth in the table below are the aggregate fees billed to the Fund
by Tait, Weller & Baker LLP ("Tait Weller") for services rendered to the Fund
during the Fund's last two fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005.

  Fiscal YE      Audit     Audit-Related                  All Other
  October 31     Fees        Fees (1)     Tax Fees (3)      Fees
- -------------   -------    -------------  ------------    ---------

    2006        $31,000     $     0         $2,600           $0

(1) All Audit-Related Fees were pre-approved by the Fund's Audit Committee.
    No Audit-Related Fees were approved by the Fund's Audit Committee pursuant
    to section 2.01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, which waives the
    pre-approval requirement for certain de minimus fees.

(2) Includes fees billed to the Fund by Tait Weller in connection with the
    Fund's change of accounting practice related to amortization of
    convertible bond premiums and discounts.

(3) "Tax Fees" include those fees billed by Tait Weller in connection with
    their review of the Fund's income tax returns for fiscal years 2005
    and 2006.  All Tax Fees were pre-approved by the Fund's Audit Committee.
    No Tax Fees were approved by the Fund's Audit Committee pursuant to
    section 2.01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, which waives the pre-approval
    requirement for certain de minimus fees.

Non-Audit Services

     During each of the last two fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and
October 31, 2006, Tait Weller did not provide any non-audit services to the
Fund or the Fund's investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore Management Company
("Davis-Dinsmore") or its affiliates or otherwise bill the Fund or Davis-
Dinsmore or its affiliates for any such non-audit services.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

     The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit
services that are proposed to be provided to the Fund by its independent
registered public accountants before they are provided to the Fund.  Such
pre-approval also includes the proposed fees to be charged by the independent
registered public accountants for such services.  The Audit Committee may
delegate the pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services and
related fees to one or more members of the Audit Committee who are
"independent," as such term is used in Form N-CSR.  Any such member's decision
to pre-approve audit and/or non-audit services and related fees shall be
presented to the full Audit Committee, solely for informational purposes, at
their next scheduled meeting.

     The Audit Committee also pre-approves non-audit services to be provided by
the Fund's independent registered public accountants to the Fund's investment
adviser if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial
reporting of the Fund and if the Fund's independent auditors are the same as,
or affiliated with, the investment adviser's auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

(a) The Fund has a designated Audit Committee in accordance with
Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act and the members of such committee are:

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                                Bancroft Fund Ltd.
                                Ellsworth Fund Ltd.
                        Davis-Dinsmore Management Company
                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                            (Adopted April 14, 2003)

These proxy voting guidelines have been adopted by the Boards of Trustees of
Bancroft Fund Ltd. and Ellsworth Fund Ltd. (collectively, the "Funds"), as well
as by the Board of Directors of Davis-Dinsmore Management Company
("Davis-Dinsmore").

The Boards of Trustees of the Funds have delegated to Davis-Dinsmore
responsibility for voting proxies received by the Funds in their capacities as
shareholders of various companies.  The Boards recognize that, due to the nature
of the Funds' investments, the Funds do not frequently receive proxies.

Davis-Dinsmore exercises its voting responsibility with the overall goal of
maximizing the value of the Funds' investments.  The portfolio managers at
Davis-Dinsmore oversee the voting policies and decisions for the Funds.
In evaluating voting issues, the portfolio managers may consider information
from many sources, including management of a company presenting a proposal,
shareholder groups, research analysts, and independent proxy research services.

Set forth below are the proxy voting guidelines:

A.   Matters Related to the Board of Directors

     1.   The Funds generally will support the election of nominees recommended
by management for election as directors.  In determining whether to support a
particular nominee, Davis-Dinsmore will consider whether the election of that
nominee will cause a company to have less than a majority of independent
directors.

     2.   The Funds generally will support proposals to de-classify boards of
directors if fewer than 66 2/3% of the directors are independent, and will
generally vote against proposals to classify boards of directors.

     3.   The Funds generally will withhold a vote in favor of a director who
has served on a committee which has approved excessive compensation arrangements
or proposed equity-based compensation plans that unduly dilute the ownership
interests of stockholders.

B.   Matters Related to Independent Auditors

     1.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of independent accountants
approved by the company.  Prior to such vote, however, Davis-Dinsmore will take
into consideration whether non-audit fees make up more than 50 to 75% of the
total fees paid by the company to the independent auditors, and the nature of
the non-audit services provided.

C.   Corporate Governance Matters

     1.   As a general rule, the Funds will vote against proposals recommended
by management of a company that are being made primarily to implement anti-
takeover measures, and will vote in favor of proposals to eliminate policies
that are primarily intended to act as anti-takeover measures.

     2.   Subject to the other provisions of these guidelines, including without
limitation provision C.1. above, the Funds generally will vote in accordance
with management's recommendations regarding routine matters, including the
following:

          a.   Fixing number of directors;

          b.   Stock splits; and

          c.   Change of state of incorporation for specific corporate purposes.

D.   Matters Related to Equity-Based Compensation Plans

     1.   The Fund generally will vote in favor of broad-based stock option
plans for executives, employees or directors which would not increase the
aggregate number of shares of stock available for grant under all currently
active plans to over 10% of the total number of shares outstanding.

     2.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of employee stock purchase
plans and employee stock ownership plans permitting purchase of company stock at
85% or more of fair market value.

E.   Contested Matters

     1.   Contested situations will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the
portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore principally responsible for the particular
portfolio security.

F.   Miscellaneous Matters

     1.   The Funds may in their discretion abstain from voting shares that have
been recently sold.

     2.   The Funds generally will abstain from voting on issues relating to
social and/or political responsibility.

     3.   Proposals that are not covered by the above-stated guidelines will be
evaluated on a case by case basis by the portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore
principally responsible for the particular portfolio security.


G.   Material Conflicts of Interest

     1.   Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time between Davis-
Dinsmore and the Funds.  Examples of conflicts of interests include:

          a.   Davis-Dinsmore may manage a pension plan, administer employee
     benefit plans, or provide services to a company whose management is
     soliciting proxies;

          b.   Davis-Dinsmore or its officers or directors may have a business
     or personal relationship with corporate directors, candidates for
     directorships, or participants in proxy contests;

          c.   Davis-Dinsmore may hold a position in a security contrary to
     shareholder interests.

     2.   If a conflict of interest arises with respect to a proxy voting
matter, the portfolio manager will promptly notify the Funds' Audit Committee
and counsel for independent directors and the proxies will be voted in
accordance with direction received from the Audit Committee.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

(a) (1) Mr. Thomas H. Dinsmore, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, serves as
the Portfolio Manager of the Registrant. He has served in that capacity since
1996. This information is as of December 28, 2006.  Mr. Dinsmore usually
receives investment recommendations from a team of research analysts prior to
making investment decisions about transactions in the portfolio.

(2) The following table provides information relating to other (non-registrant)
accounts where this portfolio manager is primarily responsible for day-to-day
management as of October 31, 2006. The portfolio manager does not manage such
accounts or assets with performance-based advisory fees, or other pooled
investment vehicles.

</TABLE>
Mr. Dinsmore is the Portfolio Manager of one other account, Ellsworth Fund Ltd.
(Ellsworth), a registered investment company with total net assets of
$116,130,162 as of October 31, 2006.  Mr. Dinsmore is Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Ellsworth. The Registrant and Ellsworth have similar
investment objectives and strategies.  As a result, conflicts of interest may
arise between the two funds if a security is not available in a sufficient
amount to fill open orders for both funds.  To deal with these situations, the
investment adviser for the Registrant and Ellsworth has adopted Trade Allocation
Procedures (the "Allocation Procedures").  The Allocation Procedures set forth
a method to allocate a partially filled order among the funds.  Pursuant to the
method, the amount of shares that each fund purchases is allocated pro rata
based on the dollar amount of each fund's intended trade or, if the order is
subject to a minimum lot size, as closely as possibly to pro rata.

The Allocation Procedures permit the adviser to allocate an order in a way that
is different from the method set forth above if (i) each fund is treated fairly
and equitably and neither fund is given preferential treatment, and (ii) the
allocation is reviewed by the adviser's chief compliance officer.

(3) The Portfolio Manager is compensated by Davis-Dinsmore Management Company,
the Adviser, through a three-component plan, consisting of a fixed base salary,
annual cash bonus, and benefit retirement plan. His compensation is reviewed
and approved by the Adviser's Board of Directors annually. His compensation may
be adjusted from year to year based on the perception of the Adviser's Board of
Directors of the portfolio manager's overall performance and his management
responsibilities. His compensation is not based on (i) a formula specifically
tied to the performance of the Registrant or Ellsworth, including performance
against an index, or (ii) the value of assets held in the Registrant's
portfolio.

(4) As of October 31, 2006, Mr. Dinsmore's beneficial ownership in the
Registrant's shares was in the range of $100,001-$500,000.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases made by or
on behalf of the registrant or any "affiliated purchaser," as defined in Rule
10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of shares or
other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities that is
registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 781).

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may
recommend nominees to the Registrant's board of trustees since those procedures
were last disclosed in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of
Regulation S-K (as required by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A
(17 CFR 240.14a-101)), or this Item 10 of Form N-CSR.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of November 28, 2006, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the officers of Bancroft Fund Ltd. (the
"Registrant"), including the Principal Executive Officer ("PEO") and Principal
Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of the Registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 30a-3(c)
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended. Based on that
evaluation, the Registrant's officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded
that, as of November 28, 2006, the Registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information
relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the Registrant's second fiscal
quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(1) A code of ethics that applies to the Fund's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer is attached hereto.

(a)(2) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are attached hereto.

(a)(3) There were no written solicitations to purchase securities under Rule
23c-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 during the period covered by the
report.

(b) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, as required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are attached hereto.

EX-99.CODE ETH

Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund, Inc.

Code of Ethics for Principal Officers
Adopted Effective May 15, 2003

I.   Preamble
   This Code of Ethics ("Code") is adopted by the Board of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. and Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income
Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") in accordance with Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the code of ethics standards established in applicable rules
and regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The
Funds are adopting this Code to establish as a policy of the Funds written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1. Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships;
2. Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in
reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") and in
other public communications made by the Funds;
3. Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and
regulations;
4. The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
5. Accountability for adherence to the Code.
II.  Applicability
The provisions of this Code shall apply to all Principal Officers of
the Funds.
III. Definitions
   Principal Officer means the principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
performing similar functions on behalf of the Funds regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Funds or by a third party, including Davis-
Dinsmore Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore").
   Compliance Officer means the Chief Compliance Officer of the Funds or
his/her designee.
   Independent Directors means the directors of the Funds who are not
"interested persons" of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act.
   Investment Company Act means the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.
IV. Principal Officers Should Act Honestly and Candidly
   Each Principal Officer owes a duty to the Funds to act with
integrity.  Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid.
Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.  Each
Principal Officer must:
1. Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while
still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required
by law or the Funds' policies;
2. Observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules
and regulations, accounting standards and Fund policies;
3. Adhere to a high standard of business ethics; and
4. Place the interests of the Funds before the Principal Officer's
own personal interests.
   All activities of Principal Officers should be guided by and adhere
to these fiduciary standards.
V.  Principal Officers Should Handle Actual and Apparent Conflicts of Interest
Ethically
   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Principal Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Funds.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Principal Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
in the Funds.
   Certain conflicts of interest covered by this Code arise out of the
relationships between Principal Officers and the Funds that already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures.
   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore of which the Principal
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes
that the Principal Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Funds or for Davis-Dinsmore, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different
effects on Davis-Dinsmore and the Funds.  The participation of the Principal
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore and is consistent with the performance by the
Principal Officers of their duties as officers of the Funds and, if addressed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Principal
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment
companies covered by this or other Codes.
   Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and
the Investment Advisers Act.  In reading the following examples of conflicts
of interest under the Code, Principal Officers should keep in mind that such a
list cannot ever be exhaustive by covering every possible scenario.
It follows that the overarching principle - that the personal interest of a
Principal Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Funds - should be the guiding principle in all circumstances.
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible;
2. Handle any actual or apparent conflict of interest ethically;
3. Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by an
investment company whereby the Principal Officer would benefit
personally to the detriment of the Funds;
4. Not cause the Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for
the personal benefit of the Principal Officer rather than to benefit
such Funds;
5. Not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
made or contemplated for the Funds to profit personally, or cause
others to profit, from the market effect of such transactions;
6. Discuss any material transaction or relationship that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest with
the Compliance Officer; and
7. Complete annually all sections of the Funds' Directors and
Officers Questionnaire pertaining to affiliations or other
relationships related to conflicts of interest.
   Types of conflict of interest situations that should be discussed
with the Compliance Officer, if material, are:
* any outside business activity that detracts from an individual's
ability to devote appropriate time and attention to his
responsibilities with the Funds;
* service as a director on the board of any public or private
company;
* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;
* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
Funds have current or prospective business dealings unless such
entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
raise any question of impropriety;
* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
relationship with, any of the Funds' service providers, other
than Davis-Dinsmore or any affiliated person thereof;
* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
transaction charges or spreads paid by the Funds for effecting
portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
than an interest arising from the Principal Officer's
employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.
VI. Disclosure
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements applicable
to the Funds as well as the business and financial operations of the
Funds; and
2. Not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
facts about the Funds to others, whether within or outside the Funds,
including to the Funds' directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations.
3. To the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility,
consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and Davis-
Dinsmore and take other appropriate steps with the goal of promoting
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
in other public communications made by the Funds.
VII. Compliance
   It is the Funds' policy to comply with all applicable laws and
governmental rules and regulations.  It is the personal responsibility of each
Principal Officer to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those
laws, rules and regulations.
VIII. Reporting and Accountability
            Each Principal Officer must:
1. Upon receipt of the Code, sign and submit to the Compliance
Officer an Acknowledgement stating that he or she has received, read,
and understands the Code.
2. By April 30 of each year submit an Acknowledgement Form to the
Compliance Officer confirming that he or she has received, read and
understands the Code and has complied with the requirements of the
Code as of the date of signing.
3. Not retaliate against any employee or Principal Officer for
reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; and
4. Notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he becomes aware of
any existing or potential violation of this Code.  Failure to do so
is itself a violation of this Code.
IX. Review and Enforcement Procedures
    Except as described otherwise below, the Compliance Officer is
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions
are presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any
particular situation.  The following procedures apply in investigating and
enforcing this Code, and in reporting on the Code:
1. The Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to
investigate any violations reported to it;
2. Violations and potential violations will be reported to the
Audit Committee (the "Committee"), counsel to the Funds and counsel
to the Independent Directors after such investigation;
3. If the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
will inform the Independent Directors who will take all appropriate
disciplinary or preventive action;
4. Appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a
review of and appropriate modifications to applicable policies and
procedures, notification of appropriate personnel at Davis- Dinsmore,
a letter of censure, or recommendation of suspension or dismissal;
5. The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting
waivers, as appropriate; and
6. Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by SEC rules.
X. Periodic Review
   At least annually, the Principal Officers and the Compliance Officer
will prepare a written report to the Boards of Directors of the Funds
describing any issues arising under this Code or procedures, including but not
limited to, information about material violations of this Code or procedures
and any sanctions imposed in response to those material violations.
   The Boards of Directors of the Funds will review this Code on an
annual basis.
XI. Other Policies and Procedures
   The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1
under the Investment Company Act are separate documents applying to Principal
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.
XII. Amendments
   This Code may not be amended except in written form, which is
specifically approved by a majority vote of the Funds' Boards of Directors,
including a majority of independent directors.
XIII. Confidentiality
   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly.  Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Funds, Davis-Dinsmore, the
Board of Directors, and counsel to the foregoing.
XIV. Internal Use
   The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
