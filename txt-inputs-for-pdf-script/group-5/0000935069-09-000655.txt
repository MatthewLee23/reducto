            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


TO THE MEMBERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
       UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS FUND, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology  Partners  Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund"),  including the
schedule of portfolio  investments,  as of December  31,  2008,  and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended,  the statements
of  changes in  members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period  then
ended, and the financial  highlights for each of the periods indicated  therein.
These financial  statements and financial  highlights are the  responsibility of
the  Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments in investment funds as of December 31, 2008, by correspondence  with
management of the underlying  investment  funds and others.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of UBS
Technology  Partners  Fund,  L.L.C.  at December  31,  2008,  the results of its
operations  and its cash  flows  for the year then  ended,  the  changes  in its
members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period  the  ended,  and the
financial  highlights for each of the indicated periods, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2008

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
     limited  partnership  under the laws of  Delaware  on  December  28,  1998,
     commenced operations on April 1, 1999 and was subsequently reorganized as a
     limited   liability  company  effective  October  15,  2002.  The  Fund  is
     registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
     Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The
     Fund's  investment  objective is to maximize capital  appreciation over the
     long-term.  The Fund pursues its  investment  objective  by  deploying  its
     assets  primarily  among a select  group of  portfolio  managers who invest
     primarily  in, or who have  particular  knowledge  within,  the  technology
     sector.   Generally,  such  portfolio  managers  conduct  their  investment
     programs  through   unregistered   investment  funds   (collectively,   the
     "Investment  Funds")  in which the Fund  invests  as a limited  partner  or
     member along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have  engaged  UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA"  or the  "Manager"),  a
     Delaware limited  liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Manager is a direct  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Manager may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that  generally,  it will
     recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from
     Members  twice each year,  near  mid-year  and  year-end.  Members can only
     transfer or assign their membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by
     operation  of  law  pursuant  to  the  death,  bankruptcy,   insolvency  or
     dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of  the
     Directors,  which may be  withheld in their sole and  absolute  discretion.
     Such  transfers  may be made even if the balance of the capital  account to
     such transferee is equal to or less than the  transferor's  initial capital
     contribution.


                                                                               7

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards  No.  157  "Fair  Value   Measurements"   ("FAS  157").  FAS  157
     establishes an authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework
     for  measuring  fair  value,  and  requires  additional  disclosures  about
     fair-value measurements.  Under FAS 157, fair value is the price that would
     be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly
     transaction  between  market  participants  at the  measurement  date.  The
     adoption of FAS 157 is required for fiscal years  beginning  after November
     15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. FAS 157 was adopted
     as of January 1, 2008 by the Fund.

     Various  inputs  are  used in  determining  the fair  value  of the  Fund's
     investments  relating to FAS 157.  These inputs are summarized in the three
     broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1--quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.
     LEVEL 2--other  significant  observable inputs (including quoted prices for
     similar securities, interest rates, prepayment spreads, credit risk, etc.)
     LEVEL 3--significant  unobservable inputs (including Fund's own assumptions
     in determining the fair value of investments.)

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Manager  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the
     terms and  conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering
     memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
     carried  at  fair  value.  All  valuations  utilize  financial  information
     supplied by each  Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.   The  Fund's  valuation
     procedures  require  the  Manager  to  consider  all  relevant  information
     available  at the time the Fund  values  its  portfolio.  The  Manager  has
     assessed factors  including,  but not limited to the individual  Investment
     Funds' compliance with FAS 157, price transparency and valuation procedures
     in  place,   subscription  and  redemption  activity,   level  of  illiquid
     securities  held,  and the  existence  or  absence  of  certain  redemption
     restrictions.   The  Manager   and/or  the  Directors  will  consider  such
     information  and  consider  whether  it is  appropriate,  in  light  of all
     relevant circumstances,  to value such a position at its net asset value as
     reported or whether to adjust such value.  The  underlying  investments  of
     each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in each
     Investment  Fund's  financial   statements.   (See  Schedule  of  Portfolio
     Investments).

     The  following is a summary of the inputs used, as of December 31, 2008, in
     valuing the Fund's  investments  at fair value.  The inputs or  methodology
     used for valuing  securities are not  necessarily an indication of the risk
     associated with investing in those securities.


                                                                               8

     the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and
     Members' Capital.

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     During the year,  the Fund  accounted  for  realized  gains and losses from
     Investment  Fund  transactions  based on the  pro-rata  ratio of the market
     value  and cost of the  underlying  investment  at the date of  redemption.
     Previously  the Fund  utilized  the cost  recovery  method.  Prior year net
     realized   gain/(loss)  from  investments  and  net  change  in  unrealized
     appreciation/depreciation   from  investments  have  been  reclassified  to
     conform with the current year  presentation  in the Statement of Changes in
     Members' Capital. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     C.   FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; offering and organization
     costs; due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
     meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has  reclassified  $3,621,868 and $50,295,408 from accumulated net
     investment   loss  and   accumulated  net  realized  gain  on  investments,
     respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year ended December
     31, 2008.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     contributions,  the amount of  estimated  taxable  income or loss that have
     been  allocated  to the Fund's  Members as of December  31, 2008 and had no
     effect on net assets.

     The Fund is subject to the  provisions  of Financial  Accounting  Standards
     Board (FASB)  Interpretation  48 ("FIN 48"),  ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN
     INCOME TAXES.  This standard  defines the  threshold  for  recognizing  the
     benefits  of   tax-return   positions  in  the   financial   statements  as
     "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires
     measurement of a tax position meeting the  more-likely-than-not  criterion,
     based on the  largest  benefit  that is more than 50  percent  likely to be
     realized. Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions taken on federal
     income tax  returns for all open tax years (tax years  ended  December  31,
     2004-2007)  and the positions to be taken for the federal income tax return
     to be filed for the tax year ended December 31, 2008 and has concluded that
     no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements.
     The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
     tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of  Operations.  During
     the year ended  December 31,  2008,  the Fund did not incur any interest or
     penalties.

     Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the Statement
     of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.


                                                                              10

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with such  transactions it is the Fund's policy that PFPC Trust
     Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA), (the  "Custodian")  take possession
     of the underlying  collateral  securities,  the fair value of which exceeds
     the  principal  amount of the  repurchase  transaction,  including  accrued
     interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the fair value of the
     collateral  declines,  realization  of the  collateral  by the  Fund may be
     delayed or limited.  As of December  31,  2008,  there were no  outstanding
     repurchase agreements.

     G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     UBSFA provides certain management and administrative  services to the Fund,
     including,  among other  things,  providing  office space and other support
     services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBSFA a monthly
     management fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's
     net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Manager's capital account.
     The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's  assets and debited  against the
     Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital  account.  A
     portion of the Management Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs  associated  with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members'  capital  derived from  operations
     (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than the  Management  Fee  which is
     similarly  allocated  to all Members  other than the  Manager as  described
     above.  In accordance with the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement,  the
     Manager is then  allocated an amount based on the  performance  of the Fund
     (the  "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement  Period,  as defined in the
     Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e., the period  commencing on the admission


                                                                              11

     of a Member to the Fund, and thereafter  each period  commencing on the day
     following the last Measurement  Period and ending generally on the first to
     occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption).  The
     Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

     The Performance Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's capital
     account at the end of the Measurement Period, provided that appreciation in
     the Member's  capital  account (net of any  Performance  Bonus) exceeds the
     Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the amount that a Member
     would have earned for a fiscal year if it had received an  annualized  rate
     of return of 20% on its opening capital account  balance,  as adjusted.  No
     Performance Bonus was earned for the year ended December 31, 2008.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
     for each meeting  attended.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the
     Chairman of the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors  each receive an
     additional   annual  retainer  in  the  amounts  of  $10,000  and  $15,000,
     respectively.  These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the
     Fund on a pro-rata basis with eleven other UBS funds where UBS Fund Adviser
     LLC is the investment adviser. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for
     all reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts expensed by the Fund
     related to  Directors  for the year ended  December  31, 2008 were  $56,756
     which is included in other expenses.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.), Inc. ("PNC"), formerly PFPC Inc., a
     member of The PNC Financial  Services Group, Inc., serves as Administrative
     and  Accounting  Agent to the Fund, and in that capacity  provides  certain
     administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  investor  related
     services.  PNC receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the average
     net  assets of the Fund  subject  to a minimum  monthly  fee,  and (ii) the
     aggregate  net  assets  of the  Fund and  certain  other  investment  funds
     sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates. Additionally,
     the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PNC.

     The  Custodian of the Fund's  assets  provides  custodial  services for the
     Fund.


                                                                              12

5.   LOAN PAYABLE

     The Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored  funds  maintained  during 2008 a
     $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured  revolving  line of credit with Bank of
     Montreal,  a Canadian  chartered bank acting through its Chicago branch. On
     January 31, 2009, the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored  funds,  reduced
     the $200,000,000 committed,  unsecured,  revolving line of credit with Bank
     of Montreal to  $75,000,000  through  July 28, 2009,  the  remainder of its
     term.

     Under the most restrictive arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that
     combined with the other  borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its
     Total Eligible Asset Value as defined by the credit  agreement.  The Fund's
     borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the  portion of the unused line of
     credit  at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
     credit to the extent of its own borrowing there under. The interest rate on
     the  borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points per
     annum.  The committed  facility also requires a fee to be paid by the Fund,
     on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of the aggregate  commitment which
     has not been utilized of 25 basis points per annum.

     For the year ended December 31, 2008 the Fund's average  interest rate paid
     on borrowings  was 1.62% per annum and the average  borrowings  outstanding
     were  $71,038.  Interest  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2008 was
     $1,152,  of which  $1,152 is payable at  December  31,  2008.  The Fund had
     $13,000,000 in borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008.

6.   INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
     of which were related parties.

     Aggregate  purchases and proceeds  from sales of  Investment  Funds for the
     year ended  December 31, 2008,  amounted to  $5,000,000  and  $126,967,700,
     respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2008.

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of 0.50% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance  incentive
     fees or allocations of 20.00% of net profits earned.

                                                                              13

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
     these  Investment  Funds is  limited to the value of these  investments  as
     reported by the Fund.

8.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience,  management  feels that the likelihood
     of such an event is remote.

9.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had  $53,149,781 of withdrawals  payable.
     On January 12, 2009 the fund paid $50,229,672. The remaining amount payable
     of $2,920,109  is scheduled to be paid in accordance  with the terms of the
     Fund's June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008 tender offers.

                   UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

The  Directors   (including  the  Independent   Directors)  last  evaluated  the
Investment  Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September 18, 2008. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by the
Adviser,  including  information  regarding the Adviser,  its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. Tables indicating comparative fee
information,  and  comparative  performance  information,  as well as a  summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and
were reviewed and discussed. The Directors discussed with representatives of the
Adviser the Fund's  operations and the Adviser's ability to provide advisory and
other services to the Fund.

The Directors reviewed,  among other things, the nature of the advisory services
to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser, including its investment process, and
the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel  proposing to
provide services to the Fund. The Directors discussed the ability of the Adviser
to manage the Fund's investments in accordance with the Fund's stated investment
objectives  and policies,  as well as the services to be provided by the Adviser
to the Fund, including administrative and compliance services, oversight of Fund
accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in meeting  legal and  regulatory
requirements  and other  services  necessary for the operation of the Fund.  The
Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of highly skilled  investment
professionals,  research analysts and administrative, legal and compliance staff
members to ensure that a high level of quality in compliance and  administrative
services  would be provided  to the Fund.  The  Directors  also  recognized  the
benefits which the Fund derives from the resources  available to the Adviser and
the Adviser's affiliates, including UBS AG and UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS
Financial"). Accordingly, the Directors felt that the quality of service offered
by the Adviser to the Fund was appropriate, and that the Adviser's personnel had
sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

The Directors reviewed the performance of the Fund and compared that performance
to the  performance  of another  investment  company  presented by UBS Financial
which has objectives and strategies  similar to those of the Fund and is managed
by  another,   third-party  investment  adviser  (the  "Comparable  Fund").  The
Directors  observed that the Fund's performance  significantly  exceeded that of
its Comparable Fund and of the relevant  indices  presented.  The Directors also
compared  the  volatility  of the  Fund  to  that of its  Comparable  Fund.  The
Directors  observed that the Fund's volatility was higher than the volatility of
its Comparable Fund.

The Directors  considered the fees being charged by the Adviser for its services
to the Fund as compared to those charged to the Comparable Fund, and as compared
to the  management  and  incentive  fees  charged  by UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.
("UBSFA") and its affiliates for other UBS alternative  investment products. The
information  presented to the  Directors  showed that the  management  fee being
charged  to the Fund was less  than the  management  fee  being  charged  to its
Comparable Fund. In comparing the management and incentive fees being charged to
the Fund to the fees  being  charged by UBSFA and its  affiliates  for other UBS
alternative  investment products, the Directors observed that the management fee
being charged to the Fund was equal to the lowest  management  fee being charged
to each of the Alternative Investment Group's other multi-manager funds, and the
Fund's  incentive  fee was below the median  incentive  fee being  charged  such
multi-manager  funds.  In light of the  foregoing,  the Directors  felt that the
combination  of  management  fee and incentive fee being charged to the Fund was
appropriate.

<PAGE>

The Directors also considered the  profitability of UBSFA both before payment to
brokers  and after  payment  to brokers  and  concluded  that the  profits to be
realized  by UBSFA and its  affiliates  under  the  Fund's  Investment  Advisory
Agreement and from other relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA were within a
range the Directors  considered  reasonable and appropriate.  The Directors also
discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large enough at that time to support a
request for breakpoints due to economies of scale. The Directors determined that
the  fees  were  reasonable.  The  Directors  concluded  that  approval  of  the
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  was in the best  interests  of the Fund and its
shareholders.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:


                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each
a "Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as
such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do
not submit matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted
for vote and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund,
the Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund and in accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of
Directors (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY


     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.


<PAGE>

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

     o    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
          Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
          an impending proxy vote;

     o    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
          personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
          outcome of a shareholder vote;

     o    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
          manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
          management, have a personal interest through investment in the
          Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     o    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in
          the outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either
          the Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

     Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

     If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

     If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's
Chief Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such
conflict of interest. Resolutions may include:

     o    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
          consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
          board of directors);

     o    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
          its behalf;

     o    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
          based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     o    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
          given the nature of the conflict.


<PAGE>

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report): (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

     To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a
fund's investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be
reviewed to ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice.
In the event a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to
these Policies and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site: y A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies
and Procedures;

     o    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     o    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
          related materials with regard to each vote;

     o    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution
          of conflicts of interest;

     o    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
          proxy-voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
          decision; and

A copy of each written investor request for information on how the Adviser voted
proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written response from the
Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for information on how the
Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).



ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

<PAGE>


The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder and
Joseph M. Sciortino, the other members of the portfolio management team, are
jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception,
and as head of the Adviser's portfolio management group since 1998. He is also
currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception. Mr. Sinder has been
associated with the Adviser since 1998 and is also an Executive Director of UBS
Financial Services. Mr. Sciortino has been associated with the Fund since
December 2006 and joined the portfolio management team at that time. Mr.
Sciortino has been associated with the Adviser since 2006 and is also a Director
of UBS Financial Services. Previously, he served as Senior Analyst at Lake
Partners, Inc. from April 2001 though August 2006.

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel at UBS
Financial Services periodically review the performance of the Portfolio
Managers.

<PAGE>


The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by UBS Financial Services or its affiliates and
not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of
stock or stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser,
subject to certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's
discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of
UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services. In general,
the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which
is necessarily weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include:
the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its Alternative Investment
Group; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to UBS Financial
Services derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed
by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute performance of the Fund and
such other accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio
Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative Investment Group; participation
by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio
Manager generally to colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula,
benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the shareholders

229.407) (as required by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101)),
or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          or persons performing similar functions, have concluded that the
          registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
          30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
          "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective, as of a date within
          90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure
          required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these
          controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
