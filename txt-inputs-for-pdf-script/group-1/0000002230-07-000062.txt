We submit herewith the financial statements of The Adams Express Company (the
Company) for the six months ended June 30, 2007. Also provided are the report
of the independent registered public accounting firm, a schedule of
investments, and other summary financial information.

Net assets of the Company at June 30, 2007 were $17.06 per share on 85,893,132
shares outstanding, compared with $15.86 per share at December 31, 2006 on
86,838,223 shares outstanding. On March 1, 2007, a distribution of $0.05 per
share was paid, consisting of $0.03 from 2006 investment income, $0.01 from
2006 short-term capital gain, and $0.01 from 2007 investment income, all
taxable in 2007. A 2007 invest-ment income dividend of $0.05 per share was paid
on June 1, 2007, and another $0.05 per share investment income dividend has
been declared to shareholders of record August 14, 2007, payable September 1,
2007.

Net investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 amounted to
$16,387,719, compared with $8,966,520 for the same period in 2006. These
earnings are equal to $0.19 and $0.11 per share.

Net capital gain realized on investments for the six months ended June 30, 2007
amounted to $35,958,118, or $0.42 per share.

The total return on the net asset value (with dividends and capital gains
reinvested) of the Company's shares was 8.3% for the six months ended June 30,
2007. The total return on the market value of the Company's shares in the
period was 8.1%. These compare to a 7.0% total return for the Standard & Poor's

Mutual Fund Average over the same time period.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, the Company's total return on net

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company is an
internally-managed fund whose investment objectives are preservation of
capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments, and an
opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to stockholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
stockholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2007 was $1,035,830,629 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $476,858,703, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $530,588,714 and $53,730,011, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any
income tax-related interest or penalties would be classified as income tax
expense.

Effective June 29, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, a clarification of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 establishes financial reporting rules regarding recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The
adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Company's net assets or results of
operations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $93,154,357 and
$89,051,906, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2007 can be
found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2007 were as follows:

value.

On December 27, 2006, the Company issued 2,301,959 shares of its Common Stock
at a price of $13.75 per share (the average market price on December 11, 2006)
to stockholders of record on November 21, 2006 who elected to take stock in
payment of the year-end distribution from 2006 capital gain and investment
income. In addition, 722 shares were issued at a weighted average price of
$13.43 per share as dividend equivalents to holders of deferred stock units and
restricted stock units under the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan.

During 2007, the Company has issued 267 shares of its Common Stock at a
weighted average price of $14.02 per share as dividend equivalents to holders
of deferred stock units and restricted stock units under the 2005 Equity

5. Retirement Plans

The Company's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers
all employees with at least one year of service. In addition, the Company has a
non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan which provides eligible
employees with retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan. Benefits
are based on length of service and compensation during the last five years of
employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30,
2007, the Company did not contribute to the plans. The Company does not
anticipate making any contribution to the overfunded plan in 2007.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic
pension cost:

</TABLE>

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company expensed
contributions of $95,309. The Company does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. Equity-Based Compensation

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during subsequent years.
All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years from date
of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2007, and
changes during the six month period then ended, is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $115,897.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based restricted
stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified
three year period, with the ultimate number of awards earned contingent on
achievement of certain performance targets. If performance targets are not
achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based awards are forfeited and
become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock
awards vest ratably over a three year period and nonperformance-based
restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors) vest over a one year
period. It is the current intention that employee grants will be
performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event
of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to defer a
portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by
delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at fair market
value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which remains
available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at June 30, 2007 is 3,289,337
shares.

The Company pays dividends and dividend equivalents on outstanding awards,
which are charged to net assets when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents
paid on restricted awards that are later forfeited are reclassified to
compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted under the 2005 Plan as
of June 30, 2007, and changes during the six month period then ended, is
presented below:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the period ending June 30, 2007 were $209,452.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the period ended June 30, 2007 were $44,876. As of June 30, 2007,
there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $807,143, a component of
additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based compensation
arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.87 years.

7. Officer and Director Compensation

The aggregate remuneration paid during the six months ended June 30, 2007 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,080,502, of which $185,041 was paid as
fees and compensation to directors who were not officers. These amounts
represent the taxable income to the Company's officers and directors and
therefore differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of
Operations that are recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that
may occur during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Company.
At June 30, 2007, the Company had securities on loan of $50,590,515 and held
collateral of $51,790,258, consisting of an investment trust fund which may
invest in money market instruments, commercial paper, repurchase agreements,
U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

                                                                             7

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company (the
Company) at June 30, 2007, the results of its operations, the changes in its
net assets and the financial highlights for each of the fiscal periods
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at June 30, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                          AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted Amended and
Restated Bylaws for the Company. Among other changes, the Amended and Restated
Bylaws:

  .   add procedures and informational requirements governing the calling of a
      stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders;

  .   add informational requirements and modify the timing for the advance
      notice of stockholder nominees for the Board of Directors and of other
      stockholder proposals --stockholders are now generally required to notify
      the Company in writing of any proposal which they intend to present at an
      annual meeting of stockholders, including any nominations for director,
      between 120 and 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing
      date of the notice for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders;

  .   implement changes to conform to the charter of the Company as recently
      amended and restated by the stockholders; and

  .   include updates to conform to changes in Maryland law and current
      corporate governance practice.

As a result of the changes to the advance notice bylaws summarized above, the
advance notice of Director nominees and any other proposals that a stockholder
seeks to bring before the 2008 Annual Meeting but does not seek to have
included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting
must be received at the office of the Company no earlier than September 19,
2007, and no later than October 19, 2007. Please note that these dates are
different from those that were provided in the Company's proxy statement for
the 2007 Annual Meeting, which dates are no longer correct.

The foregoing is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which will be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Company's next report
on Form NSAR. The Amended and Restated Bylaws are also available upon written
request to the Secretary of the Company.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
In  June  2007,  Registrant's  Board  of  Directors  adopted
Amended  and  Restated Bylaws for the  Company  that,  among
other  changes, make material changes to the  procedures  by
which  stockholders may recommend nominees  to  Registrant's
Board   of   Directors.   In  general,   the   changes   add
informational  requirements and modify the  timing  for  the
advance  notice  of stockholder nominees for  the  Board  of
Directors and of other stockholder proposals -- stockholders
are  now generally required to notify the Company in writing
of  any  proposal which they intend to present at an  annual
meeting  of  stockholders,  including  any  nominations  for
director,  between  120  and 150 days  prior  to  the  first
anniversary of the mailing date of the notice for the  prior
year's annual meeting of stockholders.

The Amended and Restated Bylaws governing the advance notice
requirements for stockholders who wish to recommend Director
nominees provide as follows:
Section  2.9.   Advance Notice of Stockholder  Nominees  for
Director and Other Stockholder Proposals.

     (a)  Annual Meetings of Stockholders.

           (1)   Nominations of individuals for election  to
the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to
be  considered by the stockholders may be made at an  annual
meeting  of  stockholders (i) pursuant to the  Corporation's
notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the  Board
of  Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation
who  was a stockholder of record both at the time of  giving
of notice by the stockholder as provided for in this Section
2.9(a)  and  at  the  time  of the annual  meeting,  who  is
entitled  to  vote at the meeting and who has complied  with
this Section 2.9(a).

           (2)   For  nominations or other  business  to  be
properly  brought before an annual meeting by a  stockholder
pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section
2.9,  the stockholder must have given timely notice  thereof
in  writing  to  the Secretary of the Corporation  and  such
other  business must otherwise be a proper matter for action
by  the  stockholders.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice
shall  set forth all information required under this Section
2.9 and shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive  office  of the Corporation not earlier  than  the
150th  day  prior to the first anniversary of  the  Date  of
Mailing  of the Notice (as defined herein) for the preceding
year's  annual  meeting nor later than  5:00  p.m.,  Eastern
Time, on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the
Date  of  Mailing  of  the Notice for the  preceding  year's
annual  meeting; provided, however, that in the  event  that
the  date  of the annual meeting is advanced or  delayed  by
more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date  of
the   preceding  year's  annual  meeting,  notice   by   the
stockholder  to be timely must be so delivered  not  earlier
than  the 150th day prior to the date of such annual meeting
and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later  of
the  120th  day prior to the date of such annual meeting  or
the tenth day following the day on which public announcement
of  the  date  of  such meeting is first made.   The  public
announcement of a postponement or adjournment of  an  annual
meeting shall not commence a new time period for the  giving
of   a   stockholder's  notice  as  described  above.   Such
stockholder's  notice  shall  set  forth  (i)  as  to   each
individual  whom  the stockholder proposes to  nominate  for
election  or  reelection as a director, (A) the  name,  age,
business  address and residence address of such  individual,
(B)  the class, series and number of any shares of stock  of
the   Corporation  that  are  beneficially  owned  by   such
individual, (C) the date such shares were acquired  and  the
investment  intent  of such acquisition,  (D)  whether  such
stockholder believes any such individual is, or is  not,  an
"interested  person" of the Corporation, as defined  in  the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended, and  the  rules
promulgated  thereunder (the "Investment Company  Act")  and
information regarding such individual that is sufficient, in
the  discretion of the Board of Directors or  any  committee
thereof  or  any  authorized officer of the Corporation,  to
make  such  determination  and  (E)  all  other  information
relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed
in  solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an
election  contest  (even  if  an  election  contest  is  not
involved),  or is otherwise required, in each case  pursuant
to  Regulation  14A (or any successor provision)  under  the
Exchange  Act  and  the  rules  thereunder  (including  such
individual's  written consent to being named  in  the  proxy
statement  as  a  nominee and to serving as  a  director  if
elected); (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder
proposes to bring before the meeting, a description of  such
business,  the  reasons for proposing such business  at  the
meeting  and any material interest in such business of  such
stockholder  and  any  Stockholder  Associated  Person   (as
defined  below), individually or in the aggregate, including
any   anticipated  benefit  to  the  stockholder   and   the
Stockholder  Associated Person therefrom; (iii)  as  to  the
stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated
Person,  (A) the class, series and number of all  shares  of
stock of the Corporation which are owned by such stockholder
and  by such Stockholder Associated Person, if any, (B)  the
nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially
but  not  of  record by such stockholder  and  by  any  such
Stockholder Associated Person, (C) whether and the extent to
which  any  hedging  or  other  transaction  or  series   of
transactions  has been entered into by or on behalf  of,  or
any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including
any  short  position or any borrowing or lending of  shares)
has  been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate
loss  to  or manage risk of share price changes for,  or  to
increase  the voting power of, such stockholder or any  such
Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any  share  of
stock    of    the   Corporation   (collectively,   "Hedging
Activities")  and (D) a general description of  whether  and
the  extent  to  which such stockholder or such  Stockholder
Associated  Person  has engaged in Hedging  Activities  with
respect   to   shares  of  stock  of  any  other  closed-end
investment  company; (iv) as to the stockholder  giving  the
notice  and  any  Stockholder Associated Person  covered  by
clauses  (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (2) of this Section
2.9(a),  the name and address of such stockholder,  as  they
appear  on  the Corporation's stock ledger and current  name
and   address,   if  different,  and  of  such   Stockholder
Associated  Person;  and  (v) to the  extent  known  by  the
stockholder giving the notice, the name and address  of  any
other  stockholder supporting the nominee  for  election  or
reelection  as a director or the proposal of other  business
on the date of such stockholder's notice.

           (3)   Notwithstanding anything in this subsection
(a)  of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, in the event  that
the  number  of  directors to be elected  to  the  Board  of
Directors  is  increased and there is no public announcement
of  such  action  at  least  130 days  prior  to  the  first
anniversary  of  the date of mailing of the  notice  of  the
preceding  year's  annual meeting,  a  stockholder's  notice
required  by  this Section 2.9(a) shall also  be  considered
timely,  but  only  with respect to  nominees  for  any  new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered
to  the  Secretary at the principal executive office of  the
Corporation not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,  on  the
tenth   day   following  the  day  on  which   such   public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

            (4)    For   purposes  of  this   Section   2.9,
"Stockholder  Associated Person" of  any  stockholder  shall
mean (i) any person controlling, directly or indirectly,  or
acting in concert with, such stockholder (including, without
limitation,  any  person who is a member of  a  "group"  for
purposes  of  Section  13(d) of the  Exchange  Act,  or  any
successor  provision, that includes such stockholder),  (ii)
any  beneficial owner of shares of stock of the  Corporation
owned  of  record  or beneficially by such  stockholder  and
(iii)  any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with such Stockholder Associated Person.

      (b)  Special  Meetings  of  Stockholders.   Only  such
business  shall  be  conducted  at  a  special  meeting   of
stockholders as shall have been brought before  the  meeting
pursuant   to   the   Corporation's   notice   of   meeting.
Nominations  of  individuals for election to  the  Board  of
Directors  may be made at a special meeting of  stockholders
at  which  directors are to be elected (i) pursuant  to  the
Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction
of  the Board of Directors or (iii) provided that the  Board
of  Directors has determined that directors shall be elected
at   such  special  meeting,  by  any  stockholder  of   the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record both at the  time
of  giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.9 and at
the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote  at
the  meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set
forth  in  this  Section 2.9.  In the event the  Corporation
calls  a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose  of
electing  one or more individuals to the Board of Directors,
any   such   stockholder  may  nominate  an  individual   or
individuals (as the case may be) for election as a  director
as  specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the
stockholder's  notice  required by  paragraph  (2)  of  this
Section  2.9(a) shall be delivered to the Secretary  at  the
principal  executive office of the Corporation  not  earlier
than  the  150th day prior to such special meeting  and  not
later  than  5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the  later  of  the
120th  day  prior to such special meeting or the  tenth  day
following the day on which public announcement is first made
of  the  date  of  the special meeting and of  the  nominees
proposed  by  the Board of Directors to be elected  at  such
meeting.   The  public  announcement of  a  postponement  or
adjournment  of a special meeting shall not commence  a  new
time  period  for  the giving of a stockholder's  notice  as
described above.

     (c)  General.

           (1)  Upon written request by the Secretary or the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, any stockholder
proposing  a  nominee  for election as  a  director  or  any
proposal  for  other business at a meeting  of  stockholders
shall provide, within five Business Days of delivery of such
request  (or such other period as may be specified  in  such
request),   written  verification,  satisfactory,   in   the
discretion  of  the  Board  of Directors  or  any  committee
thereof  or  any  authorized officer of the Corporation,  to
demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the
stockholder  pursuant to this Section 2.9.  If a stockholder
fails  to  provide  such  written verification  within  such
period, the information as to which written verification was
requested  may  be  deemed  not to  have  been  provided  in
accordance with this Section 2.9.

           (2)   Only such individuals who are nominated  in
accordance  with  this  Section 2.9 shall  be  eligible  for
election  by  stockholders  as  directors,  and  only   such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders  as
shall  have  been brought before the meeting  in  accordance
with  this  Section 2.9.  The chairman of the meeting  shall
have  the  power  to determine whether a nomination  or  any
other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made  or  proposed, as the case may be, in  accordance  with
this Section 2.9.

           (3)   For purposes of this Section 2.9,  (a)  the
"Date  of Mailing of the Notice" shall mean the date of  the
proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies for election
of  directors  and  (b)  "public  announcement"  shall  mean
disclosure (i) in a press release reported by the Dow  Jones
News  Service, Associated Press, Business Wire, PR  Newswire
or  comparable  news service or (ii) in a document  publicly
filed  by  the Corporation with the Securities and  Exchange
Commission  pursuant to the Exchange Act or  the  Investment
Company Act.

           (4)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  of
this  Section 2.9, a stockholder shall also comply with  all
applicable requirements of state law and of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters  set  forth in this Section 2.9.   Nothing  in  this
Section  2.9  shall  be  deemed to affect  any  right  of  a
stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in,  nor  the
right  of  the  Corporation to omit  a  proposal  from,  the
Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any
successor provision) under the Exchange Act.

The  Amended  and  Restated Advance Notice Bylaws  apply  to
Registrant's 2008 Annual Meeting, and the advance notice  of
Director nominees and any other proposals that a stockholder
seeks  to bring before the 2008 Annual Meeting but does  not
seek  to have included in the Company's proxy statement  and
form  of  proxy  for that meeting must be  received  at  the
office  of  the Company no earlier than September 19,  2007,
and no later than October 19, 2007.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As  of July 23, 2007,  an  evaluation  was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
July  23,  2007,  the  registrant's  disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.

A  certification  by  the registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer, pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is attached.


Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange  Act
of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed  on  its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

management or other employees who have a significant role in
the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
