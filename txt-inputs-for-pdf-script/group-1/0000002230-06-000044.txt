- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose outstanding
voting securities are held by the Company are defined as "Affiliated Companies"
in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and options
is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and distributions
to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2006 was $1,006,261,641 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $342,489,248, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $428,504,151 and $86,014,903, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $86,465,886 and
$98,499,222, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2006 can be
found on page 11.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2006 were as follows:

4. Capital Stock

The Company has 10,000,000 authorized and unissued preferred shares without par
value.

On December 27, 2005, the Company issued 2,400,624 shares of its Common Stock at
a price of $12.715 per share (the average market price on December 12, 2005) to
stockholders of record on November 22, 2005 who elected to take stock in payment
of the year-end distribution from 2005 capital gain and investment income.

During 2006, the Company issued 395 shares of its Common Stock at a weighted
average price of $13.26 per share as dividend equivalents to holders of deferred
stock units and restricted stock units under the 2005 Equity Incentive
Compensation Plan.

The Company may purchase shares of its Common Stock from time to time at such
prices and amounts as the Board of Directors may deem advisable.

Transactions in Common Stock for 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

at least one year of service. In addition, the Company has

                                                                               5
<PAGE>

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a nonqualified defined benefit plan which provides eligible employees with
retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan. Benefits are based on
length of service and compensation during the last five years of employment. The
Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that can
be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits
to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the
Company did not contribute to the plans. The Company does not anticipate making
any contributions to the plans in 2006.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic pension
cost for the six months ended June 30, 2006:

Service cost                                 $  230,485
Interest cost                                   259,008
Expected return on plan assets                 (397,018)
Amortization of prior service cost               59,888
Amortization of net loss                         90,382
- -------------------------------------------------------
Net periodic pension cost                    $  242,745
- -------------------------------------------------------

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company expensed
contributions of $91,492. The Company does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. Stock-Based Compensation

The Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985 ("1985 Plan") permits the issuance of
stock options and stock appreciation rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146
shares of the Company's Common Stock at the fair market value on the date of
grant. The exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation rights
is reduced by the per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during
subsequent years. Options are exercisable beginning not less than one year after
the date of grant and stock appreciation rights are exercisable beginning not
less than two years after the date of grant. The stock appreciation rights allow
the holders to surrender their rights to exercise their options and receive cash
or shares in an amount equal to the difference between the option exercise price
and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of surrender. All
options terminate 10 years from the date of grant if not exercised. With the
adoption of the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan at the 2005 Annual
Meeting, no further grants will be made under the 1985 Plan, although
unexercised awards granted in 2004 and prior years remain outstanding.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2006, and
changes during the period then ended, is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $60,678.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan") permits the grant of
stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock incentives to key
employees and all non-employee directors. The 2005 Plan provides for the
issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's Common Stock, including both
performance and nonperformance-based restricted stock. Performance-based
restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified three year period, with
the ultimate number of awards earned contingent on achievement of certain
performance targets. If performance targets are not achieved, all or a portion
of the performance-based awards are forfeited and become available for future
grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three
year period and nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to
non-employee directors) vest over a one year period. The 2005 Plan provides for
accelerated vesting in the event of death or retirement. Non-employee directors
also may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred
amount to be paid by delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards were
granted at fair market value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock
which remains available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at June 30, 2006
is 3,332,648 shares.

The Company pays dividends and dividend equivalents on outstanding awards, which
are charged to net assets when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents paid on
restricted awards that are later forfeited are reclassified to compensation
expense.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted under the 2005 Plan as
of June 30, 2006, and changes during the period then ended is presented below:

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals are
not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost
is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to
employees for the period ending June 30, 2006 were $116,803. The total
compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors
for the period ended June 30, 2006 were $61,748. As of June 30, 2006, there were
total unrecognized compensation costs of $740,041 related to nonvested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs
are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.17 years.

7. Expenses

The aggregate remuneration paid during the six months ended June 30, 2006 to
officers and directors amounted to $1,742,394, of which $204,230 was paid as
fees and compensation to directors who were not officers. These amounts
represent the taxable income to the Company's officers and directors and
therefore differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of
Operations that are recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at June 30, 2006, and the results of
its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for
each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at June 30, 2006, by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As  of July 12, 2006,  an  evaluation  was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
July  12,  2006,  the  registrant's  disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.

A  certification  by  the registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer, pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is attached.

of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
