reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions, or the sale of any shares. These results should not be
considered representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which
may be realized in the future.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Year in Review
We are pleased to report that the Fund generated a 6.5% total return on net
assets in 2007 despite a challenging investment climate. This return
outperformed the 5.5% return of the S&P 500 Index and the 5.8% return of the
Lipper Large Cap Core Mutual Fund Average for the year.

Our holdings in energy, consumer staples, telecom services and technology were
the principal contributors to the Fund's return in 2007. Overweight positions
(a higher percentage of assets than the S&P 500 Index) in energy and consumer
staples and underweightings in financials and consumer discretionary stocks
augmented our returns relative to the benchmark. The health care, industrial,
and materials holdings in the portfolio did not perform as well as their
corresponding sectors of the index.

The Fund's total return on market price was 9.4%. A portion of this return
resulted from trading late in the day on December 31. Without the effect of
these trades, the total market return would have been approximately 1.7% lower.
It should be noted that we were not in the market buying back any of our shares
during the final six business days of the year.

At the beginning of the year, we expected that returns would reflect a
generally improved earnings outlook, but the credit crisis in the U.S.
financial system that surfaced in the summer dramatically impacted those
expectations. The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 1/2% in
September and by the end of the year cut them another 1/2%. Massive amounts of
liquidity have been injected into U.S. and overseas money markets and billions
of dollars worth of collateralized debt obligation investments have been
written down by banks, hedge funds, and other investors. So far, most of the
problems have related to low quality "subprime" home mortgages, but banks have
indicated that credit quality is also deteriorating in home equity, auto, and
credit card loans.

The trauma in credit markets spilled over into the equity markets in the fourth
quarter of the year, as the huge write-offs at homebuilders and financial
institutions threw assumptions about the strength of the rest of the economy
into question. Steadily rising gasoline and food prices finally began to take
their toll on consumers, and what had been relatively tame inflation figures
started to worsen. The holiday retail selling season was the worst since 2003
as consumers tightened their belts and spent only modestly and principally at
the sale counters. The stock market reflected investor disappointment with
these conditions and other areas of weakness with the S&P 500 Index returning
- -3.3% in the final quarter. We were pleased that the Fund's return for the year
as a whole remained a full percentage point above that of the index.

Investment Results
At the end of 2007, our net assets were $1,378,479,527 or $15.72 per share on
87,668,847 shares outstanding. This compares with $1,377,418,310 or $15.86 per
share on 86,838,223 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2007 was $25,884,799 compared to $19,691,488 for
2006. These earnings are equal to $0.30 and $0.23 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our 0.44%
expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) in 2007 was once again very low
compared to the fund industry in general.

Net realized gains amounted to $60,426,376 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments decreased from $418,756,256 at December
31, 2006 to $410,454,970 at year end.

Dividends and Distributions
The total dividends and distributions paid in 2007 were $1.03 per share
compared to $0.90 in 2006. The table on page 19 shows the history of our
dividends and distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual
rate of distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Company's Common Stock. In 2007, the annual rate of distribution was 7.15%
compared to 6.80% in 2006. As announced on November 8, 2007, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.18 per share and capital
gains of $0.70 per share was made on December 27, 2007, both realized and
taxable in 2007. On January 10, 2008, an additional distribution of $0.05 per

share was declared to shareholders of record on February 14, 2008, payable
March 1, 2008, representing the balance of undistributed net investment income
and capital gains earned during 2007 and an initial distribution from 2008 net
investment income, all taxable to shareholders in 2008.

Outlook for 2008
The long-anticipated slowing in U.S. economic growth appears to have begun as a
result of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets, combined with higher
energy and food costs. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth swung from 2.1%
in the final quarter of 2006 to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2007 to 4.9% in
the third quarter and is likely to show 0.6% growth or less for the fourth
quarter. A recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in
GDP, is certainly a possibility in 2008, though if one occurred, we would not
expect it to be long or deep. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates and is
expected to continue to do so, while keeping a close eye on inflation. The
level of so-called "core" inflation, excluding food and energy, has been within
the range with which the Fed is comfortable. At some point, however, overall
inflation and its impact on consumers must be considered.

One of the other effects of lower interest rates is generally a weaker dollar
relative to other currencies. The dollar has been declining for some time now
and is expected to continue while interest rates are being brought down. This
should result in improved exports as U.S. goods become more competitive
overseas. While the economies of our trading partners are likely to weaken
somewhat in response to a slower economy here, they are still expected to
experience better growth than the U.S. The combination of lower interest rates,
a weaker dollar, and stronger economies overseas should result in a fairly
rapid recovery from the expected period of little or no growth. The recovery
could be derailed, however, by the development of a full-fledged banking crisis
out of the current "subprime" and collateralized debt problem.

If the economy recovers late in 2008, the stock market should follow suit.
Analysts are now beginning to lower earnings estimates for many companies and
their stock prices are already reacting strongly. Investor concern about
financial conditions is resulting in knee-jerk reactions to bad news. While
this can present some interesting opportunities, we believe there will be
equally attractive ones when there is less question as to the severity of the
decline. Our current portfolio is broadly diversified across industries with an
emphasis on companies with large exposures to economies worldwide. We have also
added several foreign companies to the portfolio to take further advantage of
economic strength overseas. With declining domestic growth in the near term,
the Fund is invested primarily in large, financially-strong companies with
leading market shares in their industries. As the recovery takes shape, we
expect to add companies with smaller capitalizations which are more highly
leveraged to economic growth, while maintaining the low risk profile of the
portfolio as a whole.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 13, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over the
ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as in
the past, namely that shares can be repurchased when the discount of the market
price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2008 through January 25, 2008, a total of 129,376 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $1,633,325 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 13.2%.

<PAGE>

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company is an
internally-managed fund whose investment objectives are preservation of
capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments, and an
opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2007 was $1,003,073,225, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $410,953,748, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $495,432,734 and $84,478,986, respectively.
As of December 31, 2007, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,962,008
of undistributed ordinary income and $436,837 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2007 were
classified as ordinary income of $34,249,231, and long-term capital gain of
$53,767,079. In comparison, distributions paid by the Company during the year
ended December 31, 2006 were classified as ordinary income of $22,964,152, and
long-term capital gain of $53,361,347. The distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within
the Company's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations. Any income tax-related interest or
penalties would be classified as income tax expense.

Effective June 29, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, a clarification of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 establishes financial reporting rules regarding recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The
adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Company's net assets or results of
operations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $141,227,739 and
$222,574,654, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31, 2007 can be
found on page 17.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:

5. Retirement Plans

The Company's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
("qualified plan") covers all employees with at least one year of service. In
addition, the Company has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan
which provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

The assumption for the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on the

according to the current asset mix.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2007 and 2006, by asset category, are as
follows:

Equity Mutual Funds include Common Stock of the Company in the amount of
$778,577 (7% of total plan assets) and $718,924 (6% of total plan assets) at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The primary objective of the Company's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a diversified
portfolio of stocks and fixed income securities.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Company anticipates making no
contribution to the plans in 2008.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are
expected to be paid:

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. The Company expensed contributions to this plan of $187,345 and
$182,985 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively. The Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Equity-Based Compensation

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during subsequent years.
All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years from date
of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2007, and
changes during the period then ended, is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost recognized for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $129,680.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based restricted
stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified
three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned contingent on

                                                                             11

achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are not achieved,
all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are forfeited and
become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock
awards vest ratably over a three year period and nonperformance-based
restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors) vest over a one year
period. It is the current intention that employee grants will be
performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event
of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to defer a
portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by
delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at fair market
value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which remains
available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2007 is
3,298,845 shares.

of December 31, 2007, and changes during the period then ended, is presented

          Balance at December 31, 2007
           (includes 72,048 performance-
           based awards and 15,423
           nonperformance-based awards)     87,471        $ 13.29
          ------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $346,937.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $86,528. As of December 31,
2007, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $486,346, a component
of additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based compensation
arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.48 years. The total fair value
of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $187,396
and $168,230, respectively.

7. Officer and Director Compensation

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2007 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,959,345, of which $278,541 was paid to
directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable income to
the Company's officers and directors and therefore differ from the amounts
reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are recorded and
expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash, U.S.
Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. At December 31, 2007, the Company had securities on loan of
$36,873,580, and held collateral of $37,702,913, consisting of an investment
trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial paper,
repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

9. New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ("FAS 157"), which provides enhanced guidance
for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard requires
companies to provide expanded information about the assets and liabilities
measured at fair value and the potential effect of these fair valuations on an
entity's financial performance. The standard does not expand the use of fair
value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair
valuation methods and applications. Adoption of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. Application of the standard is not
expected to materially impact the Company's financial statements.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company (the
"Company") at December 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the auditing standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2007 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Privacy Policy
In order to conduct its business, the Company, through its transfer agent,

certain nonpublic personal information about our stockholders of record with
respect to their transactions in shares of our securities. This information

personal information about stockholders whose shares of our securities are held
in "street name" by a financial institution such as a bank or broker.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you, our other
stockholders or our former stockholders to third parties unless necessary to
process a transaction, service an account or as otherwise permitted by law.

To protect your personal information internally, we restrict access to
nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to those employees who
need to know that information to provide services to our stockholders. We also
maintain certain other safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal
information.

                     STOCKHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Adams Express?

Adams Express Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The
stock's ticker symbol is "ADX" and may be bought and sold through registered
investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to assist you in this
regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan (see page 22).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of many daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 22.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

                                                                             21

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Company presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a) three
interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1, and (b) a
"year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the estimated
balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election
card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
election by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  6. Schedule of Investments - This schedule is included

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With  respect  to  so-called golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the company's management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded management's  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   management's
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

(a)  (1) Douglas  G.  Ober, Chairman and  Chief  Executive
     Officer, and Joseph M. Truta, President, comprise the 2
     person portfolio management team for the Registrant. Mr.
     Ober and  Mr. Truta have  served as  portfolio managers
     for the Registrant since 1991. This information  is  as
     of February 19,  2008.  Mr.  Ober is the lead member of
     the portfolio management team. Mr. Ober  and Mr.  Truta
     receive  investment  recommendations  from  a  team  of
     research analysts and make decisions jointly  about any
     equity transactions in  the portfolio.  Concurrence  of
     both portfolio  managers  is required for an investment
     recommendation to be approved.

     (2)   Mr. Ober and Mr. Truta also comprised in 2007 the
     portfolio   management  team  for   Registrant's   non-
     controlled affiliate, Petroleum & Resources Corporation
     (Petroleum), a registered investment company with total
     net  assets  of $978,919,829 as of December  31,  2007.
     Robert  E.  Sullivan was added to Petroleum's portfolio
     management team effective January 1, 2008.  Mr. Ober is
     Chairman,  Chief  Executive Officer  and  President  of
     Petroleum, Mr. Truta is Executive Vice President,  and,
     effective  January 1, 2008, Mr. Sullivan  is  Executive
     Vice President.  This information is as of February 19,
     2008.   The  Petroleum  fund is a non-diversified  fund
     focusing  on  the energy and natural resources  sectors
     and Adams is a diversified fund with a different focus,
     and  there are few material conflicts of interest  that
     may  arise  in connection with the portfolio  managers'
     management of both funds.  The funds do not buy or sell
     securities or other portfolio holdings to or  from  the
     other,  and  procedures  and  policies  are  in   place
     covering the sharing of expenses and the allocation  of
     investment opportunities, including bunched orders  and
     investments  in initial public offerings,  between  the
     funds.

     (3)   The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
     three-component plan, consisting of salary, annual cash
     incentive    compensation,   and    equity    incentive
     compensation.  The value of each component in any  year
     is  determined by the Compensation Committee, comprised
     solely of independent director members of the Board  of
     Directors.    Salaries   are   determined   by    using
     appropriate industry surveys and information about  the
     local  market as well as general inflation  statistics.
     Cash  incentive compensation is based on a  combination
     of  absolute and relative fund performance over one and
     three  year  periods as well as individual  success  at
     meeting  goals  and  objectives set  by  the  Board  of
     Directors  at  the  beginning  of  each  year.   Target
     incentives are set based on 80% of salary for the Chief
     Executive  Officer and 60% of salary for the President.
     Two-thirds  of each individual's annual cash  incentive
     is   based  on  fund  performance  and  one  third   on
     individual  success.  The portion based on  performance
     is  determined using a scale in which the target can be
     earned  by absolute fund pre- tax performance  of  10%.
     The  scale ranges from zero to 125%  of  target.    The
     result  is then modified by an average of the  one  and
     three year performance relative to the S&P 500, whereby
     each one percent outperformance or underperformance  by
     the  fund  adds  or deducts 5% from the  percentage  of
     target   earned  based  on  the  scale.   The   maximum
     percentage  of target which may be earned is  200%  and
     the  minimum  is zero.  Equity incentive  compensation,
     based  on a plan approved by shareholders in 2005,  can
     take  several forms.  Following approval of  the  plan,
     grants  of  restricted stock were made to the portfolio
     managers   in  April  2005,  with  vesting   in   equal
     proportions over a three year period.  The size of  the
     grants  was  determined  by the Compensation  Committee
     with   the   assistance  of  an  outside   compensation
     consultant.  Grants of restricted stock were also  made
     on  January  11, 2007, and January 12,  2006,  each  of
     which  will  vest at the end of three years thereafter,
     but  only upon the achievement of specified performance
     criteria.   For the 2007 grants, the target  number  of
     restricted shares will vest on January 11, 2010, if, on
     January  1,  2010, the Company's total three  year  net
     asset  value ("NAV") return meets or exceeds the  three
     year  total  NAV  return  of a  hypothetical  portfolio
     comprised of a 50/50 blend of the S&P 500 Index and the
     Lipper    Large   Cap   Core   Mutual   Fund    Average
     ("Hypothetical Portfolio"), with a lesser percentage or
     no  shares  being  earned if the  Company's  total  NAV
     return  trails  that  of  the  Hypothetical  Portfolio,
     depending  on  the  level of underperformance  on  that
     date.   In  addition,  if,  on  January  1,  2010,  the
     Company's three year total NAV return exceeds  that  of
     the  Hypothetical  Portfolio, an additional  number  of
     shares will be earned and vest, depending on the  level
     of  outperformance.   For the 2006 grants,  the  target
     number  of  restricted shares will vest at the  end  of
     three  years, with certain percentages of shares  being
     deemed   to   have  been  earned  based  on   achieving
     performance  goals  over  specified  intervening   time
     periods.   The first-one sixth of the target number  of
     shares  were  earned on January 1,  2007,  because  the
     Company's  one year total NAV return exceeded  that  of
     the Hypothetical Portfolio on that date.  The next one-
     third  of  the target number of shares were  earned  on
     January  1, 2008, because the Company's two year  total
     NAV  return exceeded that of the Hypothetical Portfolio
     on  that date.  The remaining 50% of the target  number
     of  shares  will be deemed to have been earned  if,  on
     January  1,  2009, the Company's three year  total  NAV
     return  meets  or  exceeds  that  of  the  Hypothetical
     Portfolio, with a lesser percentage or no shares  being
     earned if the Company's total NAV return trails that of
     the  Hypothetical Portfolio, depending on the level  of
     underperformance.   In  addition,  as  with  the   2007
     grants,  additional shares will be earned and  vest  if
     the  Company's three year total NAV return exceeds that
     of  the Hypothetical Portfolio, depending on the  level
     of  outperformance on that date.  Dividends and capital
     gains  paid  on  the Company's shares of  Common  Stock
     ("dividends") will be paid on all of the target  number
     of  shares of restricted stock, when such dividends are
     paid  on the Common Stock, except that no dividends  or
     capital   gains  will be paid on any  shares  that  are
     forfeited due to the failure to achieve the performance
     criteria  described above.  The basis for the portfolio
     managers'   cash   incentive   and   equity   incentive
     compensation determinations for Petroleum is  the  same
     as  for  Adams,  except that the portion  of  the  cash
     incentive  based  upon fund performance  uses  the  Dow
     Jones  Oil and Gas Index and the S&P 500 Index  as  the
     benchmarks in a 80/20 ratio, over a one and three  year
     period,  and  the  benchmarks  used  to  measure   fund
     performance  for  equity incentive  compensation  is  a
     hypothetical  portfolio comprised of a 80/20  blend  of
     the  Dow Jones Oil and Gas Index and the S&P 500 Index.
     All  of  the  above information is as of  December  31,
     2007, except as noted.

     (4)    Using a valuation date of December 31, 2007, Mr.
     Ober  beneficially owns equity securities in Registrant
     of over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
     securities in Registrant of over $1,000,000.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  Registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the Registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 28, 2008, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  Registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  Registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  Registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  28, 2008, the Registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  Registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
Registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
Registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See Registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the Registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.
