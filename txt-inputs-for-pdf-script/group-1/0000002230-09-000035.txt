                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Year in Review
In a stock market widely recognized as the worst since the Great Depression of
the 1930s, the Fund was able to again beat its benchmarks, the Standard &
Poor's 500 and the Lipper Large-Cap Core Mutual Fund Average. It is not
particularly satisfying, however, to relate that, while outperforming, the
return of the Fund was -34.4% compared to the S&P's -37.0% and the Large-Cap
Core Average of -37.2%. As disappointing as these returns were, most markets
overseas had even worse results.

Sectors of the portfolio with some of the best relative performance were not
areas traditionally emphasized in our investment activities. Those sectors
included consumer discretionary, technology, and telecommunication services.
With our relatively low exposure in these sectors, the outperformance was only
a modest help to the Fund's overall return. While the performance of the
financial sector was the weakest in absolute terms, the Fund benefited from its
underweight position and outperformance relative to the benchmark. Our
substantial health care holdings, comprising one of our larger sector
investments, outperformed the industry sector by a wide margin. Consumer
staples, as is often the case during recessionary periods, also performed
better than the overall market. Our overweighting of the energy and industrial
sectors, on the other hand, did not serve us well in 2008. Our focus on
dividend-paying stocks was an important factor in our better overall results as
investors placed increased emphasis on cash generation and payouts. The
build-up of cash and short-term investments in the second half of the year
likewise contributed to the strong relative performance of the Fund.

The financial deterioration which began in 2007 accelerated in 2008, forcing
the government to take the radical step of providing capital to banks and
insurance companies in an effort to stabilize them and avert a complete
collapse of the financial system in this country. In addition, large quantities
of outstanding debt instruments were purchased or guaranteed by the Treasury
Department to reduce the banks' exposure to losses. Several mergers of
investment banks were also arranged. Similar measures were taken in numerous
other countries as the crisis spread around the world.

With markedly reduced availability of credit from banks, the rest of the
economy sank into recession late in 2007 and has yet to recover. Dramatic
increases in energy prices in the first half of the year further hampered
activity and sparked inflation fears. As with the credit crisis, the recession
spread to other countries, reducing trade and further exacerbating the
situation. The impact of the worldwide recession was quickly reflected in
energy prices, which fell in the second half of the year even faster than they
had risen earlier. The unemployment rate rose as companies in many industries
reduced their activity and staffing. The deteriorating state of the domestic
economy, as well as most others around the world, severely impacted stock
prices, commodity prices, and the political landscape. Along with most others,
the Fund was unable to avoid much of the devastation, causing the net
unrealized gain in the portfolio to become an unrealized loss.

Investment Results
At the end of 2008, our net assets were $840,012,143 or $9.61 per share on
87,406,443 shares outstanding. This compares with $1,378,479,527 or $15.72 per
share on 87,668,847 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2008 was $21,085,039 compared to $25,884,799 for
2007. These earnings are equal to $0.25 and $0.30 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our 0.48%
expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) in 2008 was once again very low
compared to the fund industry in general.

Net realized gains amounted to $32,965,241 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments decreased from $410,454,970 at
December 31, 2007 to $(111,981,824) at year end.

Dividends and Distributions
The total dividends and distributions paid in 2008 were $0.64 per share
compared to $1.03 in 2007. The table on page 19 shows the history of our
dividends and distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual
rate of distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Company's Common Stock. In 2008, the annual rate of distribution was 5.61%
compared to 7.15% in 2007. As announced on November 13, 2008, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.13 per share and capital
gains of $0.36 per share was made on December 27, 2008, both realized and
taxable in 2008. On January 8, 2009, an additional distribution of $0.05 per

share was declared to shareholders of record on February 13, 2009, payable
March 1, 2009, representing the balance of undistributed net investment income
and capital gains earned during 2008 and an initial distribution from 2009 net
investment income, all taxable to shareholders in 2009.

Outlook for 2009
The dramatic actions taken in 2008 by the government to rebuild the financial
system and bail out other industries have yet to bear fruit. A second tranche
of capital for the banking sector is currently being allocated and the new
administration is putting together a massive stimulus program. We believe these
unprecedented efforts to increase liquidity in the markets and jump-start the
economy will eventually bear fruit. The quick success of these measures is not
assured, however, and the likelihood of the recession extending until late in
2009 or into 2010 appears high. Until such time as there are indications of
either a turnaround or a further decline, we do not expect to see the stock
market move outside of its current trading range.

A successful stimulus plan should begin to show results by the third quarter of
this year, initially in the arrest of the decline in economic activity. The
stock market should begin to recover ahead of the overall economy as valuations
begin to capture the rising expectations of investors. Such an economic and
market recovery may be impeded by the magnitude of the recessions outside the
United States. As indicated previously, other countries have been taking
measures similar to those by the U.S. to stem the declines in their economies.
If those are not successful, the reverberations are likely to be felt
domestically and any recovery delayed by several quarters. Likewise, given the
importance of the U.S. consumer's spending to the GDP, further declines in home
and stock prices in this country could also result in a more protracted and
deeper recession.

The Fund's large cash/short-term investment position will gradually be put to
use in the industries and companies which we believe have the greatest
opportunities to benefit from the anticipated recovery in both the domestic and
overseas economies. We will use the market's current period of volatility to
build these positions, as valuations disconnect from the long-term
fundamentals. The Fund will then be in a position to take the best advantage of
the market's recovery as it unfolds. We constantly strive, as managers and
shareholders, to position the Fund for success, turning challenging times such
as these into opportunities for the future.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over the
ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as in
the past, namely that shares can be repurchased when the discount of the market
price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2009 through January 23, 2009, a total of 206,800 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $1,580,545 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 15.5%.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company is an
internally-managed fund whose investment objectives are preservation of
capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments, and an
opportunity for capital appreciation.

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require the use of estimates made by Company management. Management believes
that estimates and security valuations are appropriate; however, actual results
may differ from those estimates, and the security valuations reflected in the
financial statements may differ from the value the Company ultimately realizes
upon sale of the securities.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options and money market funds) are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value. Purchased and written options are valued at the last
quoted bid and asked price, respectively. Money market funds are valued at net
asset value on the day of valuation.

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("FAS 157"), effective
January 1, 2008. There was no impact on the fair value of assets individually
or in aggregate upon adoption. In accordance with FAS 157, fair value is
defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment
in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer. FAS 157 established a
three-tier hierarchy to establish classification of fair value measurements,
summarized as follows:

  .   Level 1 -- fair value is determined based on market data obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices in active markets for
      identical investments,
  .   Level 2 -- fair value is determined using other assumptions obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices for similar investments,
  .   Level 3 -- fair value is determined using the Company's own assumptions,
      developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

The Company's investments at December 31, 2008 were classified as follows:

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2008 was $1,069,277,121, and net unrealized
depreciation aggregated $(111,580,690), which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $141,991,563 and $253,572,253, respectively.
As of December 31, 2008, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,009,961
of undistributed ordinary income and $1,767,023 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2008 were
classified as ordinary income of $23,253,237 and long-term capital gain of
$31,653,541. In comparison, distributions paid by the Company during the year
ended December 31, 2007 were classified as ordinary income of $34,249,231 and
long-term capital gain of $53,767,079. The distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are
made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect income and gains
available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any income tax-related
interest or penalties would be classified as income tax expense.

                                                                             7

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $193,895,367 and
$229,341,563, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. For written options, covered calls or collateralized puts require
deposits of securities or cash to be segregated with the custodian to guarantee
delivery or payment if the options are exercised. When an option is written, an
amount equal to the premium received by the Company is recorded as a liability
and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value of the option written.
Premiums received from unexercised options are treated as realized gains from
investments on the expiration date. Premiums received from exercised put
options reduce the cost basis of the securities purchased, and premiums
received from exercised call options are added to the proceeds from the sale of
the underlying security in determining whether there is a realized gain or
loss. The Company as writer of an option bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and the unfavorable change in the price of
the security underlying the written option. The risk associated with purchasing
an option is limited to the premium originally paid for the option. A schedule
of outstanding option contracts as of December 31, 2008 can be found on page 16.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

5. Retirement Plans

The Company's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
("qualified plan") covers all employees with at least one year of service. In
addition, the Company has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan
which provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Changes in the prior service costs and
accumulated actuarial gains and losses are recognized as accumulated other
comprehensive income, a component of net assets, in the year in which the
changes occur.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

</TABLE>

The assumption used to determine expected long-term return on plan assets was
based on historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes in
order to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each
asset class. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a
long-term inflation component, the risk-free real rate of return, and the
associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on those
overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by asset category, were as
follows:

</TABLE>

Equity securities included common stock of the Company in the amount of
$455,444 (5% of total plan assets) and $778,577 (7% of total plan assets) at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The primary objective of the
Company's pension plan is to provide capital appreciation, current income, and
preservation of capital through a diversified portfolio of stocks and fixed
income securities.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Company made no contributions to
the plans in 2008 and anticipates contributions of approximately $500,000 in
2009.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service and
certain assumptions, are eligible to be paid in the years indicated:

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. The Company expensed contributions to this plan of $169,438 and
$187,345 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively. The Company does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. Equity-Based Compensation

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during subsequent years.
All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years from date
of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2008, and
changes during the period then ended, is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost/(credit)
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $(328,271).

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based restricted
stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified
three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned contingent on
achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are not achieved,
all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are forfeited and
become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock
awards vest ratably over a three year period and nonperformance-based
restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors) vest over a one year
period. Payment of awards may be deferred, if elected. It is the current
intention that employee grants will be performance-based. The 2005 Plan
provides for accelerated vesting in the event of death or retirement.
Non-employee directors also may elect to defer a portion of their cash
compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by delivery of deferred
stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at fair market value on grant date.
The number of shares of Common Stock which remains available for future grants
under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2008 is 3,252,162 shares.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted under the 2005 Plan as
of December 31, 2008, and changes during the year then ended, is presented

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees

costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $100,793. As of December 31, 2008, there were
total unrecognized compensation costs of $451,496, a component of additional
capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based compensation arrangements
granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 1.60 years. The total fair value of shares vested
and issued during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $101,961.

7. Officer and Director Compensation

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2008 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,566,568, of which $314,031 was paid to
directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable income to
the Company's officers and directors and therefore differ from the amounts
reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are recorded and
expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to approved brokers to earn additional
income. It receives as collateral cash deposits, U.S. Government securities, or
bank letters of credit valued at 102% of the value of the securities on loan.
The market value of the loaned securities is calculated based upon the most
recent closing prices and any additional required collateral is delivered to
the Company on the next business day. Cash deposits are placed in a registered
money market fund. The Company accounts for securities lending transactions as
secured financing and receives compensation in the form of fees or retains a
portion of interest on the investment of any cash received as collateral. The
Company also continues to receive interest or dividends on the securities
loaned. Gain or loss in the fair value of the securities loaned that may occur
during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Company. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had securities on loan of $115,709,562 and held
cash collateral of $116,405,576; additional collateral was delivered the next
business day in accordance with the procedure described above. The Company is
indemnified by the Custodian, serving as lending agent, for loss of loaned
securities and has the right under the lending agreement to recover the
securities from the borrower on demand.

9. New Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 161"), which is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. FAS 161 requires
enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities, including how
such activities are accounted for and their effect on financial position,
performance and cash flows. Application of the standard is not expected to
materially impact the Company's financial statements and related disclosures.

                                                                             11

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company (the
"Company") at December 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the auditing standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2008 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

(maximum of $2.50) and commissions of $0.05 per share. There is no charge for
reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions, or the sale of any shares. These results should not be
considered representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which
may be realized in the future.

Privacy Policy
In order to conduct its business, the Company, through its transfer agent,

personal information about stockholders whose shares of our securities are held

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you, our other
stockholders or our former stockholders to third parties unless necessary to
process a transaction, service an account or as otherwise permitted by law.

To protect your personal information internally, we restrict access to
nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to those employees who
need to know that information to provide services to our stockholders. We also
maintain certain other safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal

                     STOCKHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Adams Express?

Adams Express Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The
stock's ticker symbol is "ADX" and may be bought and sold through registered
investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to assist you in this
regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan (see page 23).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of many daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 23.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

                                                                             21

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Company presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a) three
interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1, and (b) a
"year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the estimated
balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election
card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
election by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With   respect  to  so-called  golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the company's management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded management's  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   management's
recommendation on these types of proposals.


Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

    (a)(1)  As of the date of this filing, Douglas G.  Ober,
Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer,  Joseph  M.  Truta,
President,  and  David W. Weaver, Executive Vice  President,
comprise  the  3 person portfolio management  team  for  the
Registrant.  Mr. Ober and Mr. Truta have served as portfolio
managers for the Registrant since 1991 and Mr. Weaver  since
March  2008.   Prior  thereto, Mr.  Weaver  served  as  Vice
President-Research from January 2007 to March 2008 and as  a
research analyst from 2004 to January 2007.  Mr. Ober is the
lead member of the portfolio management team.  Messrs. Ober,
Truta  and Weaver receive investment recommendations from  a
team  of research analysts and make decisions jointly  about
any equity transactions in the portfolio. Concurrence of the
portfolio   managers   is   required   for   an   investment
recommendation to be approved.

    (2)   As  of the date  of this filing, Mr. Ober and  Mr.
Truta  also  serve  on  the portfolio  management  team  for
Registrant's non-controlled affiliate, Petroleum & Resources
Corporation  (Petroleum),  a registered  investment  company
with  total  net assets of $538,936,942 as of  December  31,
2008.   Mr.  Ober is Chairman, Chief Executive  Officer  and
President  of  Petroleum, and Mr. Truta  is  Executive  Vice
President.   The  Petroleum fund is a  non-diversified  fund
focusing on the energy and natural resources sectors and the
Registrant is a diversified fund with a different focus, and
there  are few material conflicts of interest that may arise
in  connection  with the portfolio managers'  management  of
both  funds.   The  funds do not buy or sell  securities  or
other   portfolio  holdings  to  or  from  the  other,   and
procedures and policies are in place covering the sharing of
expenses  and  the  allocation of investment  opportunities,
including  bunched orders and investments in initial  public
offerings, between the funds.

      (3)  The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
three-component  plan,  consisting of  salary,  annual  cash
incentive  compensation, and equity incentive  compensation.
The value of each component in any year is determined by the
Compensation  Committee,  comprised  solely  of  independent
director  members  of the Board of Directors  ("Committee").
The  Committee  has  periodically  employed  a  compensation
consultant to review the plan and its components.   Salaries
are  determined  by using appropriate industry  surveys  and
information  about  the  local market  as  well  as  general
inflation statistics.  Cash incentive compensation is  based
on  a combination of absolute and relative fund performance,
with  a  two-thirds  weighting, and  individual  success  at
meeting  goals and objectives set by the Board of  Directors
at  the  beginning of each year, with a one-third weighting.
Target  incentives are set annually based on 80%  of  salary
for  the  Chief Executive Officer and 60% of salary for  the
President and Executive Vice President. The fund performance
used  in determining cash incentive compensation is measured
over  both  a one-year period, accounting for two-thirds  of
the calculation, and a three-year period, which accounts for
one-third.  The total return on net asset value of the  Fund
over  each  of the two periods is used to determine  a  base
percentage of target, which, for 2008, was then adjusted  by
performance  relative  to the S&P 500  Index.   Using  these
calculations, the cash incentive compensation can range from
0%  to  a maximum of 200% of the established target.  Equity
incentive   compensation,  based  on  a  plan  approved   by
stockholders  in  2005, can take several  forms.   Following
approval  of the plan, grants of restricted stock were  made
to  the  portfolio managers in April 2005, with  vesting  in
equal proportions over a three year period.  The size of the
grants  was  determined by the Committee with the assistance
of an outside compensation consultant.  Grants of restricted
stock  were  also made on January 10, 2008 (previous  grants
had  been  made on January 11, 2007, and January 12,  2006),
which  vest  three  years after grant,  but  only  upon  the
achievement of specified performance criteria.  For the 2008
grants, the target number of restricted shares will vest if,
on  the  January  1  prior  to the vest  date  ("measurement
date"),  the  Registrant's total three year net asset  value
("NAV")  return  meets or exceeds the three year  total  NAV
return  of  a hypothetical portfolio comprised  of  a  50/50
blend  of  the  S&P 500 Index and the Lipper Large-Cap  Core
Mutual Fund Average ("Hypothetical Portfolio"). Depending on
the level of Registrant's outperformance or underperformance
of  the  Hypothetical Portfolio on the measurement date,  an
additional  number  of shares, a lesser  percentage,  or  no
shares will be earned and vest.

    (4)   Using a valuation date of December 31,  2008,  Mr.
Ober  beneficially  owns  equity  securities  in  Registrant
valued  over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
securities in Registrant valued over $1,000,000.  Mr. Weaver
beneficially  owns  equity securities in  Registrant  valued
between $100,001 and $500,000.

   (b)  Not applicable.

Certification of Principal Executive Officer

     In  connection with the Certified Shareholder Report of
The  Adams Express Company (the Company) on Form N-CSR for
the  period  ended  December 31, 2008,  as  filed  with  the
Securities  and Exchange Commission on the date hereof  (the

Officer  of  the  Company, certify, pursuant  to  18  U.S.C.
Section  1350,  as adopted pursuant to Section  906  of  the
