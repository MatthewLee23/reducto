                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Each year at this time we share with you our perspective on the past year. In
addition, we discuss what the new year might hold for the economy, equity
markets in general, and your Fund.

The Year in Review
We are pleased to report that the Fund had a total return on net asset value of
12.1% for the year, compared to the 10.9% return of the Standard & Poor's 500
Index and the 5.3% return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In what proved
to be a difficult year for equities, the broad diversification of the Fund and
its emphasis on relatively low risk, dividend-paying stocks was responsible for
the index-beating performance.

The equity markets were quite volatile during the year, as they were strongly
influenced by a number of factors. As a result, by the end of the third quarter
the indices were approximately where they started the year. One of the largest
factors impacting the markets was the price of oil, which spiked several times
and reached a high of $55.17 in October. Investor concern over the effect of
energy prices on economic growth resulted in heavy selling and a market decline
each time the oil price rose sharply.

A second factor influencing the markets was the action taken by the Federal
Reserve in the second half of the year. Concerned about the absolute level of
interest rates and some early signs of inflationary pressures, the Fed raised
the Fed Funds rate five times, taking it from 1%, the lowest it had been in
over 40 years, to 2.25%. The Fed further indicated that it would continue to
raise the rate until there was evidence of a balance between monetary stimulus
and inflation. The markets initially reacted negatively as expectations of
higher rates were incorporated in valuations. As the second half progressed,
inflation remained tame and the economy continued to grow at a solid pace, so
investors began to view the rate moves as healthy. By raising rates during a
period of good growth and modest inflation, the Fed was giving itself room to
lower rates should the economy show signs of weakening.

Other factors weighing on the markets included the apparent deterioration of
the situation in Iraq and the U.S. Presidential election. The cost of
supporting the Iraqi interim government in dollars and lives mounted steadily,
with no end in sight, as the year wore on. The strongly opposing views of the
Presidential candidates insured a tough election battle and a close race.
Fortunately, there was a clear winner in the end, rather than the predicament
that occurred in 2000. The pro-business views of the eventual winner, Mr. Bush,
were reflected in the market rally in the final two months of the year.

After ten months of volatility but essentially no upward movement, the 9%
increase in the S&P 500 Index in November and December was indicative of
investor confidence in the outlook. The full year return on the Index of 10.9%
was less than half that of the prior year, but more in line with long-term
averages. As might be expected, energy stocks were the best performers, with a
return of 31.5%, and utilities and telecommunications services companies also
turned in strong performances, providing returns of 20% or better. After
stellar returns in 2003, technology stocks were poor performers in 2004 with a
2.6% return, while health care stocks were the weakest with a 1.7% return.

Our sector results were mixed in 2004. We maintained an overweight position
relative to the S&P 500 Index in energy, industrial, health care, and utility
stocks, and we outperformed the Index sector in health care and were even in
the industrials. Our reductions in holdings of large pharmaceutical companies
in 2003 in favor of health care equipment and services companies worked well
for the Fund in 2004 as the drug companies endured a lot of adverse publicity.
Our portfolio did not have sufficient exposure to oil service stocks to beat
the Index in energy and we have avoided nuclear utilities, which were the
best-performing names in the utility sector. We were underweighted in consumer,
financial, and technology stocks, in part due to early sales, and outperformed
the Index in all of them. This combination enabled the Fund to generate a 12.1%
return and beat the Index by 120 basis points or 11.0%.

Within the Index, the stocks of smaller to medium capitalization (less than $14
billion) companies performed better than those of the largest capitalization
(greater than $25 billion) companies. This was also the case in 2003, as
investors gravitated to the stocks of companies with the greatest leverage to
economic growth. Part of the outperformance of the Adams Express portfolio
relative to the S&P 500 Index is explained by the fact that only 44% of the
Fund falls in the largest capitalization group whereas 66% of the value of the
Index is in that group. It should be noted, though, that only 70% of our
portfolio is represented in the Index at all and several of our holdings not
included in the Index would fall in the largest capitalization group.

Interestingly, the stocks with the highest beta, or volatility relative to the
market, did far worse than lower-beta stocks. While investors wanted better
returns, they appeared unwilling to take added risks to obtain them.
Consequently, our focus on lower-risk stocks, characterized by low betas,
boosted our returns in 2004. The relative performance of higher- and
lower-yielding stocks also showed investors' tendency to avoid risk, as stocks
with higher yields had returns almost twice

                                                                             3

those with lower yields. With our emphasis on the generation of income, we
benefited from the better performance of higher-dividend-paying stocks during
the year. The opposite was the case in 2003, despite the favorable change in
tax laws enacted that year related to dividends.

Investment Results
At the end of 2004 our net assets were $1,295,548,900 or $15.04 per share on
86,135,292 shares outstanding. This compares with $1,218,862,456 or $14.36 per
share on 84,886,412 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2004 was $19,008,405 compared to $15,613,355 for
2003. These earnings are equal to $0.23 and $0.19 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. It should be
noted that in 2004 we received $2,400,000, or 3 cents per share, in an
extraordinary dividend from Microsoft Corp. This accounted for a significant
portion of the increase in income from a year ago. As Microsoft is not expected
to repeat such a payment in 2005, shareholders should not expect to see a
similar increase in earnings per share in 2005. In 2004, our 0.43% expense
ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a very low level
compared to the industry. This ratio was not impacted by the Microsoft dividend.

Net realized gains amounted to $54,713,903 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $282,112,491 at December
31, 2003 to $343,670,412 at year end.

Dividends and Distributions
The total dividends and distributions paid in 2004 were $0.90 per share
compared to $0.78 in 2003. As announced on November 11, 2004, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.11 and capital gains of
$0.64 was made on December 27, 2004, both realized and taxable in 2004. On
January 13, 2005, an additional distribution of $0.05 per share was declared
payable March 1, 2005, representing the balance of undistributed net investment
income and capital gains earned during 2004 and an initial distribution from
2005 net investment income, all taxable to shareholders in 2005.

Outlook for 2005
With a relatively lackluster holiday selling season on the consumer side and no
year-end surge in capital spending in the industrial sector, it appears that
the final quarter of 2004 will show annualized U.S. real economic growth of
about 3.5% over the third quarter and real GDP for the year of about 3.6%. Most
economists agree that this represents a level of growth that should be
sustainable for an extended period of time, barring exogenous factors. We
believe, however, that there are a number of factors which are likely to dampen
growth in 2005 from this level.

First among these factors is the probable continued high cost of energy for
consumers and businesses. Early indications are that OPEC members are generally
in favor of crude oil prices of $35 per barrel or more. As the only producers
with any spare capacity, these nations will be able to control supply to
international markets. Worldwide demand for oil, having grown over 3% in 2004
as a result of strong economies, particularly in China and India, is unlikely
to slow much in 2005. We can therefore expect that prices will average between
$35 and $40 per barrel, with probable spikes to higher levels.

The second factor that may impede growth is likely to be periodic increases in
short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has made it relatively clear
that it will continue to take action to drive up interest rates in 2005. With
the Federal Funds rate currently 2.25% and an apparent Fed target of 3-4%, we
can expect four or five increases to occur during the year. This would serve to
dampen the financing of receivables and inventory at businesses. The spread
between short and long-term interest rates is quite wide at this point, so we
do not expect much increase in longer rates as the spread is allowed to narrow
to a more normal range. Therefore, capital spending should not be impacted
significantly by the rise in short-term rates. With capacity utilization in
manufacturing industries running between 77% and 80%, one would expect
companies to be planning and purchasing equipment for expansion in 2005 unless
they anticipate a dramatic slowing in economic growth. While companies do not
appear to anticipate this, purchasing managers did not choose to take advantage
of the beneficial depreciation rules which expired in 2004, so they may not be
expecting capacity to tighten further this year.

The amount of U.S. government spending during the year will also have an effect
on the growth of the economy. After a budget deficit of nearly $500 billion in
fiscal 2004, the Bush administration has been working to reduce the size of the
deficit for 2005 and beyond by cutting the budget where possible. This is
likely to cut into spending for defense, highways, and agriculture, among
others. While not a large part of the economy, government spending tends to
have multiplier effects across numerous industries.

The strength of the dollar and the U.S. trade deficit also have a bearing on
economic growth. The dollar has been declining since early 2002 and the
government does not seem inclined to take measures to halt the slide. Despite
the decline, the deficit in trade has not diminished significantly, as U.S.
consumers continue to buy foreign goods at higher and higher prices. Nor has it
enabled U.S. companies to raise their prices

on similar goods. To date the trade deficit has been funded through the
purchase of U.S. debt by the counterparty countries, notably China, but they
may discontinue this should the dollar continue to fall. Any such slowdown in a
willingness to accept dollars would first impact government debt markets, but
would reverberate throughout all financial markets.

These and other factors will exert varying levels of influence on the
performance of the economy in 2005, in turn impacting corporate earnings and
the equity markets. Our belief is that the growth of the economy will moderate
further from 2004's 3.6% level, to about 3% in 2005. The operating earnings of
companies in the S&P 500, after experiencing an increase of 18% in 2003 and
likely growth of about 19% in 2004, will probably only be up in single digits
in 2005. On a fundamental basis, slower growth in earnings would translate into
a more modest rise in stock prices, especially if there is any downward
movement in the price/earnings ratio, which often happens in the later stages
of an economic cycle. Thus, we are not looking for returns to exceed those of
2004.

With the Adams Express portfolio broadly diversified across industry sectors,
as noted in the chart on page 1, we would expect to generate reasonable returns
in 2005. The stock market has generated double-digit returns, well above
long-term averages, for the last two years. We expect that returns in 2005 will
not be as great, given the current stage of the economic cycle. As previously
discussed, we have been emphasizing lower-risk, dividend-paying stocks for some
time. Investors in general are expected to continue to reduce the relative risk
in their portfolios and focus more on income generation, the result being that
those stocks and our portfolio should perform better than the market. We have
taken steps to reduce the investments in the portfolio which perform best in
the early part of an economic cycle, chiefly industrials, and those which are
most sensitive to rising interest rates, especially smaller banks. The
long-term outlook reflected in our investment portfolio does not dictate that
we make wholesale changes in order to anticipate normal economic fluctuations.
The amount of cash and short-term investments stood at 2.6% of net assets at
year end, compared to 3.9% one year ago.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over
the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as
in the past, namely that shares can be repurchased when the discount of the
market price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2005 through January 20, 2005, a total of 257,500 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $3,333,750 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 11.9%.

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Baltimore, Maryland on April 27, 2005, is expected to be mailed on or about
March 15, 2005.

By order of the Board of Directors,

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2004 was $1,006,863,288, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $344,326,207, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $460,886,167 and $116,559,960, respectively.
As of December 31, 2004, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $2,660,113
of undistributed ordinary income and $0 of undistributed long-term capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2004 were
classified as ordinary income of $22,205,063, and long-term capital gain of
$53,052,651. In comparison, distributions paid by the Company during the year
ended December 31, 2003 were classified as ordinary income of $17,389,281, and
long-term capital gain of $46,939,087. The distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within
the Company's capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for
distribution under income tax regulations.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee, and recommendations
to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2004 were $161,361,633 and
$187,414,341, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. The Company, as writer of an option, bears the risks of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31, 2004 can be
found on page 17.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2004 were as follows:

The Company has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146 shares of the Company's Common Stock
at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are exercisable
beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend and vest
over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the optionees to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Company during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2004, there were
229,364 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $12.07
per share. During 2004, the Company granted options, including stock
appreciation rights, for 62,067 shares of Common Stock with an original
weighted average exercise price of $12.57 per share. During the year, stock
appreciation rights relating to 8,134 stock option shares were exercised at a
weighted average market price of $13.05 per share and the stock options
relating to these rights which had a weighted average exercise price of $3.79
per share were cancelled. At December 31, 2004, there were outstanding
exercisable options to purchase 119,283 common shares at $3.15-$17.77 per share
(weighted average price of $12.38), and unexercisable options to purchase
164,014 common shares at $4.74-$17.77 per share (weighted average price of
$11.31). The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding
exercisable and unexercisable options was 6.00 years and 6.82 years,
respectively. Total compensation expense recognized in 2004 related to the
stock option and stock appreciation rights plan was $275,601. At December 31,
2004, there were 1,180,685 shares available for future option grants.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment which
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses
transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or
that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. Currently, the
Company recognizes compensation cost for a stock option award over the award's
vesting period. The revised FAS 123 is effective as of the beginning of the
first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact it will have on its operations and
financial statements.

5. Retirement Plans

The Company provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-contributory
nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based on years of
service and compensation during the last five years of employment.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

The primary objective of the Company's pension plan is to provide capital
appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital through a portfolio
of stocks and fixed income securities. The equity portion of the portfolio may
range from 50% to 75% of total portfolio assets. The fixed income portion of
the portfolio may range from 25% to 50% of total portfolio assets and cash may
range from 0% to 25% of total portfolio assets. Subject to these allocation
ranges, the portfolio may be invested in any of the following securities:
common stocks, preferred stocks, American Depository Receipts, foreign
securities, mutual funds, convertible securities, municipal bonds, corporate
bonds, US government securities, and US government agency securities.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Company anticipates making
contributions in the amount of $18,844 to the plans in 2005.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at December 31, 2004, the results of
its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

maintain personal information about stockholders whose shares of our securities

To protect your personal information internally, we restrict access to

maintain certain other safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal
information.

                     SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Adams Express?

Adams Express Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Pacific Exchange. The stock's ticker symbol is "ADX" and may be bought and sold
through registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to
assist you in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan
(see page 22).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers and on
Mondays in The Wall Street Journal in a table titled "Closed-End Funds." The
table compares the net asset value at the close of the week's last business day
to the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or
premium.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, usually with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend checks.
You can request direct deposit with American Stock Transfer either on-line or
by calling them at the phone number provided on page 22. At this time, AST does
not offer direct deposit of your year-end distribution checks. We have been
advised by AST that it will be able to offer this service for the 2005 year-end
distribution.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

                                                                             21

               SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Company presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a) three
interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1, and (b) a
"year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the estimated
balance of the net investment income for the year and the net realized capital
gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to receive the year-end
distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this distribution, all
stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement notice and an election
card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
election by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  6. Schedule of Investments - This schedule is included

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the companys management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  companys
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio companys management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations of the companys management.   When  we
believe that the managements recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   managements
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the companys overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the companys stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a companys
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote on anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the companys management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or
this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 11, 2005, an evaluation was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls   and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
February  11, 2005, the registrant's disclosure controls  and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting  (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has   materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.
