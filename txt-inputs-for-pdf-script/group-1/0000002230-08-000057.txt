1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company is an
internally-managed fund whose investment objectives are preservation of
capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments, and an
opportunity for capital appreciation.

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require the use of estimates made by Company management. Management believes
that estimates and security valuations are appropriate; however, actual results
may differ from those estimates, and the security valuations reflected in the
financial statements may differ from the value the Company ultimately realizes
upon sale of the securities.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to stockholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value.
Purchased and written options are valued at the last quoted asked price.

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("FAS 157"), effective
January 1, 2008. There was no impact on the fair value of assets individually
or in aggregate upon adoption. In accordance with FAS 157, fair value is
defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment
in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer. FAS 157 established a
three-tier hierarchy to establish classification of fair value measurements,
summarized as follows:

  .   Level 1 -- fair value is determined based on market data obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices in active markets for
      identical investments,
  .   Level 2 -- fair value is determined using other assumptions obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices for similar investments,
  .   Level 3 -- fair value is determined using the Company's own assumptions,
      developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

The Company's investments at June 30, 2008 are classified as follows:

</TABLE>

*Comprised of short-term investments and securities lending collateral.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
stockholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2008 was $1,078,603,181 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $213,620,973, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $361,956,158 and $148,335,185, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Company's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any
income tax-related interest or penalties would be classified as income tax
expense.

3. Investment Transactions

The Company's investment decisions are made by a committee of management, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2008 were $108,005,817 and
$103,510,389, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Company. When the Company writes an option, an amount equal to the premium
received by the Company is recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted
to the current fair value of the option written. Premiums received from
unexercised put/call options are treated as realized gains from investments,
premiums received from exercised put options reduces the cost basis of the
securities purchased, and premiums received from exercised call options are
added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security in determining
whether there is a realized gain or loss. The Company as writer of an option
bears the risks of possible illiquidity of the option markets and the
unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option.
The risk is limited to the premium originally paid for the option. A schedule
of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2008 can be found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2008 were as follows:

5. Retirement Plans

The Company's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
("qualified plan") covers all employees with at least one year of service. In
addition, the Company has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan
which provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Company's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Company deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30,
2008, the Company did not contribute to the plans. The Company does not
anticipate making any contribution to the overfunded qualified plan in 2008.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic
pension cost:

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers substantially
all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Company expensed
contributions of $84,817. The Company does not provide postretirement medical
benefits.

6. Equity-Based Compensation

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Company during subsequent years.
All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years from date
of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2008, and
changes during the six month period then ended, is presented below:

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost/(credit)

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 3,413,131 shares of the Company's
Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based restricted
stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of a specified
three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned contingent on
achievement of certain performance targets. If performance targets are not
achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based awards are forfeited and
become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based restricted stock
awards vest ratably over a three year period and nonperformance-based
restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors) vest over a one year
period. It is the current intention that employee grants will be
performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event
of death or retirement. Non- employee directors also may elect to defer a
portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by
delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at fair market
value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which remains
available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at June 30, 2008 is 3,258,668
shares.

A summary of the status of the Company's awards granted under the 2005 Plan as
of June 30, 2008, and changes during the six month period then ended, is
presented below:

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        Balance at June 30, 2008 (includes 103,354
         performance-based awards and 16,965
         nonperformance-based awards)               120,319    $13.18
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>
Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the period ending June 30, 2008 were $247,205.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-
employee directors for the period ended June 30, 2008 were $53,968. As of June
30, 2008, there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $731,029, a
component of additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based
compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.79 years. The total fair
value of shares vested during the six month period ended June 30, 2008 was
$106,363.

7. Officer and Director Compensation

The aggregate remuneration paid during the six months ended June 30, 2008 to
officers and directors amounted to $1,665,343, of which $167,281 was paid as
fees and compensation to directors who were not officers. These amounts
represent the taxable income to the Company's officers and directors and
therefore differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of
Operations that are recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

8. Portfolio Securities Loaned

The Company makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Company accounts for
securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives compensation
in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the investment of any
cash received as collateral. The Company also continues to receive interest or
dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at all times by
collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the securities loaned plus
accrued interest. The market value of the loaned securities is calculated based
upon the most recent closing prices and any additional required collateral is
delivered to the Company on the next business day. Gain or loss in the fair
value of the securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will
be for the account of the Company. At June 30, 2008, the Company had securities
on loan of $102,136,348 and held collateral of $106,477,312, consisting of an
investment trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial
paper, repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company (the
"Company") at June 30, 2008, the results of its operations, the changes in its
net assets and the financial highlights for each of the periods presented, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of
securities at June 30, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers,
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There  were no material changes to the procedures  by  which
shareholders  may  recommend nominees  to  the  registrant's
board  of directors made or implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to the requirements  of
Item  407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR  229.407)  (as
required  by Item 22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-
101)), or this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As  of July 22, 2008,  an  evaluation  was performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation, the  registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
July  22,  2008,  the  registrant's  disclosure controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.

A  certification  by  the registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer, pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is attached.

of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
