To Our Shareholders

May 9, 2008

The current calendar year has seen the convertible securities market, as
measured by the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index, outperform the major
equity market indices as well as U.S. corporate bonds, while underperforming
high yield U.S. corporate bonds. Within the convertible universe, Merrill Lynch
reports that speculative grade convertibles have outperformed investment grade
convertibles, which may be because small and midcap stocks have outperformed
large capitalization stocks.

As some alternative forms of financing have been substantially reduced by the
de-leveraging of investment banks, many issuers are turning to convertible
securities as the most viable source for raising capital. This development has
become especially true of finance companies and banks. The first five months of
2008 has seen a net increase in U.S. convertible securities outstanding of over
$20 billion, raising convertible market value to $333.5 billion from $313.1
billion, as measured by Merrill Lynch. Average yields rose as many new issues
came to market with over 7% yields. Average conversion premiums have actually
fallen slightly to approximately 42% and parity delta (a measure of the
sensitivity of the price of a convertible security to movements in the price of
the underlying common stock) is around 65%, which is historically within the
normal range of the market. These numbers, measured by Merrill Lynch, appear to
us to be indicative of a healthy convertible market. In this changing financial
environment, we believe that reasonable investment opportunities are available
in convertible issue form from many different companies and industries.

Performance in the Fund's second fiscal quarter was enhanced by its exposure to
the Minerals and Mining and Energy industries. Among the better performing
issues in the portfolio were McMoRan Exploration Co. (Energy), Oil States
International, Inc. (Energy) and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (Minerals
and Mining). Performance was held back by exposure to the Computer Software and
Telecommunications industries.

Bancroft's market return, with dividends reinvested, outperformed the Merrill
Lynch All Convertibles Index (the "Index") over the one-year period ended April
30, 2008, while underperforming over the five- and ten-year periods. The Fund's
NAV, also with dividends reinvested, after adjustment for fund expenses (the
Index includes no expenses), and for the Fund's fiscal 2004 rights offer and
the February 2008 tender offer, outperformed the Index over the one- and five-
year periods. Although the Fund's performance over the ten-year period was
comparable to that of the Index, over that time period the Fund's volatility,
as measured by the standard deviation of both market performance and NAV
performance, was substantially lower than that of the Index for that time
period. Many market professionals consider the volatility of past returns to be
a useful approximation of past levels of financial risk. A higher volatility
level is considered to equate to a higher measure of risk, and thus the Fund's
results were achieved with lower levels of risk than that implied by the Index.
This measure of historic results may not reflect future performance but we
believe that it is informative. The Fund has sought to provide total returns to
shareholders that compare favorably to those of the equity markets with less
volatility.

There are many closed-end funds that make use of leverage through the issuance
of Auction Rate Preferred Shares (ARPS). These shares are designed to have
their dividend rate set through a periodic auction, usually every 7 to 35 days.
When a successful auction occurs, holders who wish to liquidate their holdings
may do so. If the auction does not attract sufficient bids to clear

                                                 continued on the following page

                                                                          Page 1

the market, the remarketing agent (usually a bank) generally steps in to fill
the gap. This system functioned for twenty years with only an occasional
auction failure. During the first calendar quarter of 2008 many agents refused
to step in and so many auctions failed. Although such auction failures did not
mean that the ARPS were in danger of default, holders who wished to liquidate
their positions could not do so. The issuers have had to pay a penalty rate
until the auctions were successful or the ARPS were redeemed. At this time, 25%
of existing ARPS issued by closed-end funds have been called, with more
expected to follow. Bancroft has never issued any preferred shares and so has
not been subjected to the uncertainties created in the market by these recent
events.

The results of the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders are shown in the
Miscellaneous Notes section of this report. We thank you for your support.
During the past quarter the Fund conducted a successful tender offer which
concluded on February 29th with the purchase of 14.5% of the outstanding shares
of the Fund. At its May meeting, the Board of Trustees declared a dividend of
$0.21 per share. The dividend consists of undistributed net investment income
and will be payable on June 26, 2008 to shareholders of record on June 12,
2008.

(1)     Contingent payment debt instrument which accrues contingent interest.
        See Note 1(f).

(2)     Security not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
        (i.e., the security was purchased in a Rule 144A or a Regulation D
        transaction). The security may be resold only pursuant to an exemption
        from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, typically to
        qualified institutional buyers. The Fund generally has no rights to
        demand registration of these securities. The aggregate market value of
        these unregisterd securities at April 30, 2008 was $14,175,811 which
        represented 13.2% of the Fund's net assets.

(3)     Investment is a restricted security, valued at fair value as determined
        in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of
        Trustees. It is possible that the estimated value may differ
        significantly from the amount that might ultimately be realized in the
        near term, and the difference could be material. The fair value of this
        security represented 1.1% of the Fund's net assets.

(4)     These securities are required to be converted on the dates listed; they
        generally may be converted prior to these dates at the option of the
        holder.

Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Organization - Bancroft Fund Ltd. (the "Fund"), is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company.

(b) Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(c) Indemnification - Under the Fund's organizational documents, each trustee,
officer or other agent of the Fund (including the Fund's investment adviser) is
indemnified against certain liabilities that may arise out of performance of
their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification clauses.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet
occurred. The risk of material loss as a result of such indemnification is
considered remote.

(d) Federal Income Taxes - The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all
of its taxable income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
believed necessary.

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48).
FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Fund's tax return to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The interpretation
became effective for tax years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption
of FIN 48 has had no impact on the Fund's financial statements.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(e) Security Valuation - Investments in securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at market using the last reported sales price,
supplied by an independent pricing service, as of the close of regular trading.
Listed securities, for which no sales were reported, are valued at the mean
between closing reported bid and asked prices as of the close of regular
trading. Unlisted securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued
using an evaluated quote provided by the independent pricing service, or, if an
evaluated quote is unavailable, such securities are valued using prices
received from dealers, provided that if the dealer supplies both bid and asked
prices, the price to be used is the mean of the bid and asked prices. The
independent pricing service derives an evaluated quote by obtaining dealer
quotes, analyzing the listed markets, reviewing trade execution data and
employing sensitivity analysis. Evaluated quotes may also reflect appropriate
factors such as individual characteristics of the issue, communications with
broker-dealers, and other market data. Securities for which quotations are not
readily available, restricted securities and other assets are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures approved by the Board
of Trustees. Short-term debt securities with original maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost.

(f) Security Transactions and Related Investment Income - Security transactions
are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell is executed)
with gain or loss on the sale of securities being determined based upon
identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain securities, known
as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax regulations require the
Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in addition to interest
income actually received. Contingent interest income amounted to 6 cents per
share for the six months ended April 30, 2008. In addition, Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on contingent payment
debt instruments to interest income. At April 30, 2008 there were unrealized
losses of approximately 14 cents per share on contingent payment debt
instruments.

(g) Change in Method of Accounting - Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began
amortizing discounts and premiums on all debt securities. Prior to November 1,
2004, the Fund amortized discounts on original issue discount debt securities.
The new method of amortization was adopted in accordance with the provisions of
the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies and the
financial highlights presented herein have been restated to reflect the new
method retroactive to November 1, 2001. The effect of this accounting change is
included in the financial highlights for the years ended October 30, 2003 and
2004. The cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on the
total net assets of the Fund or on distributions for tax purposes, but resulted
in a $103,986 increase in the cost of securities held and a corresponding
$103,986 reduction in the net unrealized gains based on the securities held on
November 1, 2001. These changes had no effect on previously reported total net
assets or total returns.

(h) Distributions to Shareholders - Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date
and paid annually. The amount and character of income and capital gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006
were as follows:

                                       2007           2006
                                    ----------     ----------
Ordinary Income                     $5,102,460     $4,395,566
Net Realized Gain on Investments     2,621,312             --

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

At April 30, 2008 unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment
securities on a tax basis were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation                         $  8,861,127

Unrealized depreciation                           (9,148,005)
                                                ------------
Net unrealized depreciation                         (286,878)

Cost for federal income tax purposes            $105,744,373


(i) Accounting Pronouncements - In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. As of April 30, 2008, the Fund does not believe
the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial statement amounts,
however, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop
the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements on changes in net
assets for the period.

NOTE 2 - MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore"). Pursuant to the investment advisory
agreement, Davis-Dinsmore provides the Fund with investment advice, office space
and facilities. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, the Fund
pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month an advisory fee for such month
computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the first $100,000,000 and 0.50% of the
excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

The Fund, pursuant to an administrative services agreement with Davis-Dinsmore,
has agreed to pay Davis-Dinsmore for certain accounting and other administrative
services provided to the Fund. Under the administrative services agreement, the
Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month a fee for such month
computed at an annual rate of 0.05% of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are officers and directors of Davis-
Dinsmore.

NOTE 3 - PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

Tender Offer
On January 31, 2008 the Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 758,754 of its
shares of beneficial interest, representing approximately 12.5% of its issued
and outstanding shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share, at a
price per share equal to 95% of the net asset value per share as of the close
of regular trading on the American Stock Exchange on February 29, 2008.  The
Fund conducted the Offer pursuant to an Agreement dated January 11, 2008
between the Fund and certain Fund shareholders.

The tender offer expired on February 29, 2008. The Fund accepted 880,154
properly tendered shares at a price per Fund share equal to $19.36, which was
95% of the net asset value per Fund share as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
on February 29, 2008.

Approximately 2,294,566 shares of beneficial interest, 38% of the Fund's issued
and outstanding shares of beneficial interest, were validly tendered.  Because
more than 758,754 shares had been validly tendered, the Fund elected to take up
and pay for 121,400 additional shares for a total of 880,154 total shares to be
taken up and paid for pursuant to the Offer.  Shares were accepted for payment
on a pro rata basis.  Accordingly, approximately 38.36% (880,154 shares
accepted for payment divided by 2,294,566 shares validly tendered) of the
validly tendered shares of each shareholder were accepted for payment.  These
accepted shares represented approximately 14.5% of the total shares of
beneficial interest outstanding prior to the commencement of the tender offer.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of June 5, 2008 an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the officers of the Registrant, including the
Principal Executive Officer ("PEO") and Principal Financial Officer ("PFO"), to
assess the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures,
as that term is defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"), as amended. Based on that evaluation, as required by
Rule 30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or
15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)), the
Registrant's officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded
that, as of June 5, 2008, the Registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information
relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the
period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(1) The code of ethics disclosure required by Item 2 is not applicable to
this semi-annual report.

(a)(2) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)),
are attached hereto.

(a)(3) There were no written solicitations to purchase securities under Rule
23c-1 under the Act (17 CFR 270.23c-1) sent or given during the period covered
by the report by or on behalf of the Registrant to ten or more persons.

(b) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, as required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act
(17 CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)), and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of
Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) are attached hereto.
