LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                   July 29, 2005

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
had an increase in its net asset value (NAV) of 8.48%, vs. an increase of 9.88%
(with net dividends) for the Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile
Index.(1) Based on market price, the Fund's shares rose 5.43% for the six-month
period. As a result, the Fund's discount to its NAV stood at 13.29% on June 30,
2005, compared with a discount of 10.78% at the beginning of the period.

CHILE: AIDED BY DOMESTIC AND EXPORT DEMAND

The period was a positive one for emerging stock markets as a group, both in
absolute terms and compared with developed stock markets, at least for
US-dollar-based investors. Emerging markets initially rallied, but then turned
sharply down in March on worries that rising US interest rates could threaten
global growth. These fears subsided in the latter part of the period, with
inflation appearing to be under control and as long-term US interest rates
remained fairly stable. Investors' appetite for risk in general returned and
emerging markets ended the period on a solid note.

Latin America outperformed the broader emerging markets group by a handy margin,
reflecting continued healthy economic fundamentals and a positive earnings
backdrop.

From a fundamental perspective, the Chilean economy performed well, buoyed by
continuing high copper prices as well as improving domestic demand. Its equity
market was further aided by ample liquidity. On the earnings front,
first-quarter 2005 results were supportive, with particular robust results in
the retail, electric utilities, and pulp and paper industries.

PERFORMANCE: CONSUMER STAPLES OFFSETS CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY

Within this environment, the Fund benefited from the favorable market
conditions, though it trailed its benchmark for the six-month period. Good
showings from the Fund's consumer discretionary and health care holdings were
offset by the underperformance of its materials and industrials stocks. The
Fund's overweighting in the consumer staples sector also hindered its relative
return, as the group had only a modest gain overall. With regard to the Fund's
private equity investments (which accounted for about 1.91% of the Fund's assets
as of June 30, 2005), we continued to hold a toll road operator that, although
it has performed relatively well in the time we've owned it, tends to detract
from portfolio performance during periods of market outperformance, due to its
more limited liquidity.

OUTLOOK: THE ECONOMY IS KEY

Our outlook on Chile and its stock market remains generally positive. The
economy has made significant progress over the past year and a half, and we
think it has potential to deliver sustained growth into 2006, driven primarily
by expanding domestic consumption. The economic growth has also been boosting
corporate cash flows, resulting in a related rise in investment plans.
Inflation, meanwhile, appears to be under control, staying within a range (2% to
4%) targeted by the country's central bank. The bank has been incrementally
increasing short-term interest rates this year,

                                        1
<Page>

to 3.5% as of late July, citing the positive trend of Chile's output growth. As
for commodity prices, in particular copper, we believe that the supply/demand
balance could continue to work in Chile's favor.

Regarding market risk, valuations in Chile remain on the high side compared with
most emerging market countries, and near the top end of their own historical
trading range. This could make the market relatively vulnerable to any
disappointing news, especially with regard to external risks in our view, such
as a slowdown in global growth or a spike in long-term US interest rates. That
said, we believe that should Chile maintain good economic performance, its stock
market could continue to enjoy premium valuations.

Respectfully,

/s/ Matthew J.K. Hickman

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A. ORGANIZATION

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

NOTE B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless it is determined that
this method would not represent fair value.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available, or whose values have been materially affected by events occurring
before the Fund's Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities' primary
market, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the
direction of, the Board of Directors under procedures established by the Board
of Directors. The Fund may utilize a service provided by an independent third
party which has been approved by the Board of Directors to fair value certain
securities. At June 30, 2005, the Fund held 1.91% of its net assets in a
security valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
established by the Board of Directors with an aggregate cost of $4,296,118 and
fair value of $3,302,941. The Fund's estimate of fair value assumes a willing
buyer and a willing seller neither acting under a compulsion to buy or sell.
Although this security may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the
prices realized on such sales could differ from the price originally paid by the
Fund or the current carrying value, and the difference could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term time
deposit available through Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian.
The short-term time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a
short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders sufficient to

                                       12
<Page>

relieve it from all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund would owe if the securities were sold and the
proceeds repatriated on the valuation date as a liability and reduction of
realized/unrealized gains. Taxes on foreign income are recorded when the related
income is recorded. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Fund incurred
$333,364 of such expense.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

      (I) market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund may invest in securities of foreign countries and governments
which involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic
investments. Such risks generally include, among others currency risks
(fluctuations in currency exchange rates),

                                       13
<Page>

information risk (key information may be inaccurate or unavailable) and
political risk (expropriation, nationalization or the imposition of capital or
currency controls or punitive taxes). Other risks of investing in foreign
securities include liquidity and valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in the emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by that fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected
to be illiquid which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk
and may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any
liquid trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to
liquidate these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities.
Although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions,
the prices realized on such sales could be substantially less than those
originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and these difference
could be material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded
may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements
applicable to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

NOTE C. AGREEMENTS

Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("CSAM") serves as the Fund's investment
adviser with respect to all investments. CSAM receives as compensation for its
advisory services from the Fund, an annual fee, calculated weekly and paid
quarterly, equal to 1.20% of the first $50 million of the Fund's average weekly
market value or net assets (whichever is lower), 1.15% of the next $50 million
and 1.10% of amounts in excess of $100 million. For the six months ended June

services, an annual fee, out of the advisory fee payable to CSAM, calculated
weekly and paid quarterly, equal to 0.20% of the Fund's average weekly market
value or net assets (whichever is lower). For the six months ended June 30,
2005, these sub-advisory fees amounted to $143,370.

For the six months ended June 30, 2005, Celfin earned approximately $65,000 in
brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of the
Fund.

                                       14
<Page>

Bear Stearns Funds Management Inc. ("BSFM") serves as the Fund's U.S.
administrator. The Fund pays BSFM a monthly fee that is calculated weekly based
on the Fund's average weekly net assets. For the six months ended June 30, 2005,
BSFM earned $55,829 for administrative services.

Celfin Capital S.A. Administradora de Fondos de Capital Extranjero ("AFCE")
serves as the Fund's Chilean administrator. For its services, AFCE is paid a
fee, out of the advisory fee payable to CSAM, that is calculated weekly and paid
quarterly at an annual rate of 0.05% of the Fund's average weekly market value
or net assets (whichever is lower). In addition, AFCE receives a supplemental
administration fee, an annual reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and an
accounting fee. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the administration fees,
supplemental administration fees and accounting fees amounted to $35,843,
$35,208 and $2,974, respectively.

Merrill Corporation ("Merrill"), an affiliate of CSAM, has been engaged by the
Fund to provide certain financial printing services. For the six months ended
June 30, 2005, Merrill was paid $11,476 for its services to the Fund.

The Independent Directors receive fifty percent (50%) of their annual retainer
in the form of shares purchased by the Fund's transfer agent in the open market.
Directors as a group own less than 1% of the Fund's outstanding shares.

NOTE D. CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Fund is 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value. Of the 10,139,926 shares outstanding at June 30, 2005, CSAM
owned 14,615 shares.

NOTE E. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the six months ended June 30, 2005, purchases and sales of securities, other
than short-term investments, were $33,220,216 and $34,544,015, respectively.

NOTE F. CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund, together with other funds/portfolios advised by CSAM (collectively,
the "Participating Funds"), participates in a $75 million committed, unsecured,
line of credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Deutsche Bank, A.G. as
administrative agent and syndication agent and State Street Bank and Trust
Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate commitment fee
at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the Credit
Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner as is
determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In addition, the
Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Fund had no borrowings
under the Credit Facility.

NOTE G. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales and Post-October losses (as later defined), and
excise tax regulations.

The tax character of dividends and distributions paid during the year ended
December 31, 2004 were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                        <C>
Ordinary Income                            $  4,765,765
Long-Term Capital Gains                    $ 17,846,270
</Table>

Under current tax law, certain capital losses realized after October 31 within a
taxable year may be deferred

                                       15
<Page>

and treated as occurring on the first day of the following tax year
("Post-October losses"). For the tax period ended December 31, 2004, the Fund
did not incur Post-October losses.

At June 30, 2005, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as well
as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $107,461,619, $66,087,361,
$(1,079,540) and $65,007,821, respectively.

NOTE H. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., with EquiServe, Inc. acting as service agent to the
aforementioned and, not by The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., will act as program administrator (the "Program Administrator")
of the InvestLink(SM) Program (the "Program"). The purpose of the Program is to
provide existing shareholders with a simple and convenient way to invest
additional funds and reinvest dividends in shares of the Fund's common stock
("Shares") at prevailing prices, with reduced brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to EquiServe. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends. The number
of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of his
dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less applicable
fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The investment date
for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next trading day if the
25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend reinvestment is the
dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses dividends and funds of
participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open market. Such purchases
will be made by participating brokers as agent for the participants using normal
cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased through the Program will be
allocated to participants as of the settlement date, which is usually three
business days from the purchase date. In all cases, transaction processing will
occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except where temporary curtailment
or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of
the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market conditions make prudent
investment impracticable. In the event the Program Administrator is unable to
purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of funds, such funds will be
returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an

                                       19
<Page>

anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are expected to be submitted in
written form. In addition, all sale requests received by the Program
Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be
submitted in written form.

EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Program Administrator, administers the Program
for participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further

                                       20
<Page>

information as to tax consequences of participation in the Program, participants
should consult with their own tax advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:
(800) 730-6001 (U.S. and Canada) or (781) 575-3100 (outside U.S. and Canada).
All correspondence regarding the Program should be directed to: EquiServe Trust
