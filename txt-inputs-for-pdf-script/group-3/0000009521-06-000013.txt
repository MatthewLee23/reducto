Bancroft Fund Ltd. (successor to Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.) operates as
a closed-end, diversified management investment company and invests primarily
in convertible securities, with the objectives of providing income and the
potential for capital appreciation -- which objectives the Fund considers to
be relatively equal, over the long-term, due to the nature of the securities
in which it invests.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS ------------------------------------------------------------

June 12, 2006

This is our first shareholder report since the Fund reorganized as a
Delaware statutory trust, and changed its name to Bancroft Fund Ltd.  As a
Delaware statutory trust, the amount of state taxes that the Fund will pay
annually will be reduced, and the Fund will enjoy a higher flexibility in
governance.  For example, from time to time, in between scheduled meetings of
the Board, the trustees are asked to approve certain matters affecting the
Fund. Formerly, all board members were required to sign a consent
approving such matters. As a Delaware statutory trust, the trustees are
permitted to act between regular meetings by a consent signed by at least 75%
of the trustees. This will permit the Board to act in a timelier manner if a
trustee is unavailable to approve such action.

The convertible market has undergone many major changes over the thirty-five
years that Bancroft has existed.  One of the most significant was the creation
of mandatory conversion securities (a type of convertible that has a required
conversion or redemption feature).  These convertibles usually provide a
much higher yield than their underlying common stock, but rather than the
holder having the option of taking the shares or cash at maturity or
redemption, the holder must convert even if conversion value is less than issue
price.  Issues of this type became a sizeable portion of the convertible
market starting in the '90s. While these issues (sometimes known as DECS,
PERCS, or ELKS) tend to be more volatile than traditional convertibles, they
have performed well as a group.  According to Citigroup, since December 1994
the mandatory portion of the convertible market has provided the best
performance, followed by cash coupon convertible bonds, convertible
preferreds and zero coupon bonds (which also tend to be the least volatile).

The convertible securities market also has undergone substantial changes over
the last two years.  According to Citigroup, the average premium-to-conversion
value (the positive difference between the market price of a convertible
security and the value of the underlying common stock) for May 2004 was 42.9%;
by May 2005 it had fallen to 35.2% and this May it was 30.3%.  Citigroup also
measured a decline in current yield from 3.9% in 2004 and 2005 to 3.5% in May
2006. Much of this premium compression and current yield decline was due to
rising equity prices.  The higher premium and current yield levels in 2004
made for a convertible market that was less equity sensitive and more interest
rate sensitive than it is now. The convertible market also appears to have
ended its decline in total market value over the last three years.  New issues
and market appreciation were greater than redemptions as Merrill Lynch
measured a rise in the market value from $263 billion in 2005 to $266 billion
in May 2006.

The Fund's performance based on industry exposure has changed recently.  While
positive returns continue to come from the energy sector, we have also seen
better performance in our aerospace and defense exposure.  Underperforming
industries have been health care and pharmaceuticals. We believe these
underperforming industries lagged due to the perception that there will be
greater government involvement in these businesses.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS (continued)-------------------------------------------------

For the ten-year period ended April 30, 2006, Bancroft's net asset value (NAV)
had outperformed the average NAV performance of the closed-end funds included
in the closed-end convertible fund category tracked by Lipper, Inc. and
published in the Lipper Closed-End Performance Analysis.  However, for the one-
year, three-years and five-years ended April 30, 2006, the Fund underperformed
the average NAV of the eleven funds in its category.

Visit our website, www.bancroftfund.com, for additional information on the
Fund, such as a monthly portfolio summary which lists the Fund's largest
holdings.  Quarterly updates may be found in the Financial Reports section, and
other financial data is often included in press releases.

The results of the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders are shown in the
Miscellaneous Notes section of this report.  We thank you for your support. At
its May meeting, the Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.18 per share.
The dividend consists of undistributed net investment income and will be
payable on June 29, 2006 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2006.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)---------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Organization - Bancroft Fund Ltd. (successor to Bancroft Convertible Fund,
Inc. (established in 1971)) (the "Fund"), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
On March 17, 2006, the Fund was reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust from
a Delaware corporation.

(b) Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(c) Indemnification - Under the Fund's organizational documents, each trustee,
officer or other agent of the Fund (including the Fund's investment adviser) is
indemnified against certain liabilities that may arise out of performance of
their duties to the Fund.  Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification clauses.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet
occurred.  The risk of material loss as a result of such indemnification is
considered remote.


                                                                         Page 11

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)---------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(d) Federal Income Taxes - The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all
of its taxable income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies.  Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
believed necessary. At October 31, 2005, the Fund had a capital loss
carryforward of $4,596,296 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset
future net capital gains, if any.  To the extent that the carryforward is used,
no capital gains distributions will be made.  $4,045,634 of the total
carryforward expires in 2010, $424,570 expires in 2011 and $126,092 expires in
2013.

(e) Security Valuation - Investments in securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at market using the last reported sales
price as of the close of regular trading.  Listed securities for which no
sales were reported are valued at the mean between closing reported bid and
asked prices as of the close of regular trading.  Unlisted securities traded in
the over-the-counter market are valued using an evaluated quote provided by an
independent pricing service. The independent pricing service derives an
evaluated quote by obtaining dealer quotes, analyzing the listed markets,
reviewing trade execution data and employing sensitivity analysis.  Evaluated
quotes may also reflect appropriate factors such as individual characteristics
of the issue, communications with broker-dealers, and other market data.
Securities for which quotations are not readily available, restricted
securities and other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by management pursuant to procedures approved by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term debt securities with original maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost.

(f) Securities Transactions and Related Investment Income - Security
transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell
is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being determined based
upon identified cost.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain securities, known
as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax regulations require the
Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in addition to interest
income actually received. Contingent interest income amounted to 6 cents per
share for the six months ended April 30, 2006.  In addition, Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on contingent payment
debt instruments to interest income.  At April 30, 2006 there were unrealized
gains of approximately 1 cent per share on contingent payment debt instruments.

(g) Change in Method of Accounting - Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began
amortizing discounts and premiums on all debt securities.  Prior to
November 1, 2004, the Fund amortized discounts on original issue discount debt
securities.  The new method of amortization was adopted in accordance with the
provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment
Companies and the financial highlights and statement of changes in net assets
presented herein have been restated to reflect the new method retroactive to
November 1, 2001.  The effect of this accounting change is included in the
financial highlights for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  The
cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on the total net
assets of the Fund or on distributions for tax purposes, but resulted in a
$103,986 increase in the cost of securities held and a corresponding $103,986
reduction in the net unrealized gains based on the securities held on
November 1, 2001.  These changes had no effect on previously reported total net
assets or total returns.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)---------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(h) Distributions to Shareholders - Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date
and paid annually.  The amount and character of income and capital gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles.  The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 were
$3,894,853 and $3,826,570, respectively, both from  ordinary income.

NOTE 2 - MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore"). Pursuant to the investment advisory
agreement, Davis-Dinsmore provides the Fund with investment advice, office
space and facilities.  Under the terms of the investment advisory
agreement, the Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month an
advisory fee for such month computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the first
$100,000,000 and 0.50% of the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net assets
in such month.

The Fund, pursuant to an administrative services agreement with Davis-Dinsmore,
has agreed to pay Davis-Dinsmore for certain accounting and other
administrative services provided to the Fund.  Under the administrative
services agreement, the Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore compensation in the amount of
$25,000 per year, payable on a monthly basis.

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are officers and directors of Davis-
Dinsmore.

NOTE 3 - PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

At April 30, 2006 there were 5,625,134 shares of beneficial interest
outstanding, with a par value of $0.01 per share. During the six months ended
April 30, 2006, 36,681 shares were issued in connection with reinvestment of
dividends from net investment income, resulting in an increase in paid-in
capital of $655,492.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $37,881,705 and $39,268,807, respectively, for the six months ended
April 30, 2006.

A distribution of $0.18 per share from net investment income was declared on
May 16, 2006, payable June 29, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of
business June 15, 2006.

At April 30, 2006 unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment
securities on a tax basis were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation            $ 10,067,850
Unrealized depreciation              (2,716,138)
                                   ------------

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of May 17, 2006 an evaluation was performed under the supervision

Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of the Registrant's

that, as of May 17, 2006, the Registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information
relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the
period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

financial officer, as required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act
