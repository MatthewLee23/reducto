To Our Shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

June 14, 2007

Five years ago the market environment was substantially different than it is
today.  The yield on high-yield bonds is lower than in 2002, while the yield on
long-term (10 years or more) government bonds is very similar to where it was.
In looking back, it appears that the high-yield bond market was attractive
relative to the government bond market and the convertible market, which became
mostly equity insensitive in 2002. Currently, we think that these  positions
have changed and that the convertible market has a higher potential value.

The U.S. domestic convertible securities market has been expanding in 2007.
Citigroup has measured this market at $331 billion on May 31, 2007, up from
$297 billion in December 2006 (this does not include the structured securities
discussed in last quarter's letter to shareholders). The overall convertible
market continues to provide attractive investment opportunities.  While the
average yield has dropped from 3.2% in December 2006 to 3.0% in May 2007, the
average premium-to-conversion value has fallen from 27.5% to 24.4% during that
period. The reduced yield and premium appear to have resulted from higher
underlying stock prices.

An important measure of the convertible market is known as "delta." This is an
indicator of how "equity sensitive" convertibles are.  For example, a delta of
50 would imply that if the common stock underlying the convertible security
were to move 10%, the convertible would move by half of that or 5%.  During the
late 1990's delta ranged from 57.1 to 75.9, indicating that the movement of
most convertibles was substantially in proportion to that of their underlying
common stocks.  In 2002, the weighted average delta of the Citigroup
Convertible Index fell to 36.1 indicating that the prices of many convertibles
were not moving substantially in tandem with their underlying common stocks.
Historically convertibles have been used as equity alternatives more than they
have been used as fixed income alternatives.  The Citigroup Convertible Index,
with a delta of 36.1, was far more interest rate sensitive than equity
sensitive. This can have an impact on performance. Since 2002, delta has moved
back up to 66.1, a more traditional level that is consistent with the theme of
using convertibles as an equity alternative.

Performance for fiscal year-to-date has been enhanced by the Fund's exposure to
the multi-industry and chemical industries.  Among the better-performing issues
in the portfolio were Celanese Corp. (chemical industry) and LSB Industries,
Inc. (multi-industry).  Industries that underperformed included semiconductors,
financial services and real estate. The lesson we draw from this is that
investors appear to believe that basic industries are the most attractive in
this new world economy.

For the calendar year-to-date, one- and ten-year periods ended April 30, 2007,
Bancroft's  market return outperformed the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index
while underperforming for the five-year period. The Fund's net asset value
(NAV) when adjusted for fund expenses (the index includes no expenses) and the
fiscal 2004 rights offering outperformed over the  calendar year-to-date, one-
and ten-year periods, and underperformed for the five-year period.  For that
ten-year period, the Fund's volatility as measured by the standard deviation
was lower than that of the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index. Many market
professionals consider the volatility of past returns to be a useful
approximation of the past levels of risk. This measure of historic results may
not reflect future performance but we believe that it is informative.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Organization -- Bancroft Fund Ltd. (the "Fund"), established in 1971, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company.

(b) Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

(c) Indemnification -- Under the Fund's organizational documents, each trustee,
officer and other agent of the Fund (including the Fund's investment adviser) is
indemnified against certain liabilities that may arise out of performance of
their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification clauses.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet
occurred. The risk of material loss as a result of such indemnification is
considered remote.

(d) Federal Income Taxes -- The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all
of its taxable income within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
believed necessary. At October 31, 2006, the Fund utilized capital loss
carryforward of $4,596,296 available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset
net capital gains.


                                                                         Page 11

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Fund's tax return to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. Management has not completed
their analysis on whether the adoption of FIN 48 will have an impact to the
financial statements.

(e) Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national
securities exchange are valued at market using the last reported sales price as
of the close of regular trading. Listed securities for which no sales were
reported, are valued at the mean between closing reported bid and asked prices
as of the close of regular trading. Unlisted securities traded in the
over-the-counter market are valued using an evaluated quote provided by an
independent pricing service. The independent pricing service derives an
evaluated quote by obtaining dealer quotes, analyzing the listed markets,
reviewing trade execution data and employing sensitivity analysis. Evaluated
quotes may also reflect appropriate factors such as individual characteristics
of the issue, communications with broker-dealers, and other market data.
Securities for which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities
and other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by
management pursuant to procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Short-term
debt securities with original maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost.

(f) Securities Transactions and Related Investment Income -- Security
transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy or sell
is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being determined based
upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain securities, known
as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax regulations require the
Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in addition to interest
income actually received. Contingent interest income amounted to 6 cents per
share for the six months ended April 30, 2007. In addition, Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on contingent payment
debt instruments to interest income. At April 30, 2007 there were unrealized
losses of approximately 9 cents per share on contingent payment debt
instruments.

(g) Change in Method of Accounting -- Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began
amortizing discounts and premiums on all debt securities. Prior to November 1,
2004, the Fund amortized discounts only on original issue discount debt
securities. The new method of amortization was adopted in accordance with the
provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment
Companies and the financial highlights and statement of changes in net assets
presented herein have been restated to reflect the new method retroactive to
November 1, 2001. The effect of this accounting change is included in the
financial highlights for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The
cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on the total net
assets of the Fund or on distributions for tax purposes, but resulted in a
$103,986 increase in the cost of securities held and a corresponding $103,986
reduction in the net unrealized gains based on the securities held on
November 1, 2001. These changes had no effect on previously reported total net
assets or total returns.

(h) Distributions to Shareholders -- Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date
and paid annually. The amount and character of income and capital gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005
were $4,395,566 and $3,894,853, respectively, both from ordinary income.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

At April 30, 2007 unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment
securities on a tax basis were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation                         $ 11,838,936
Unrealized depreciation                           (3,614,635)
                                                ------------
Net unrealized appreciation                        8,224,301

Cost for federal income tax purposes            $123,775,204

(i) Market Risk -- It is the Fund's policy to invest at least 65% of its assets
in convertible securities. Although convertible securities do derive part of
their value from that of the securities into which they are convertible, they
are not considered derivative financial instruments. However, certain of the
Fund's investments include features which render them more sensitive to price
changes of their underlying securities. Thus they expose the Fund to greater
downside risk than traditional convertible securities, but generally less than
that of the underlying common stock. The market value of those securities was
$27,355,998 at April 30, 2007, representing 20.5% of net assets.

(j) New Accounting Pronouncements -- In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. As of April 30, 2007, the Funds do not believe
the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial statement amounts,
however, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop
the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements on changes in net
assets for the period.

NOTE 2 - MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Davis-Dinsmore
Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore"). Pursuant to the investment advisory
agreement, Davis-Dinsmore provides the Fund with investment advice, office space
and facilities. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, the Fund
pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month an advisory fee for such month
computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the first $100,000,000 and 0.50% of the
excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

The Fund, pursuant to an administrative services agreement with Davis-Dinsmore,
has agreed to pay Davis-Dinsmore for certain accounting and other administrative
services provided to the Fund. Under the administrative services agreement, the
Fund pays Davis-Dinsmore on the last day of each month a fee for such month
computed at an annual rate of 0.05% of the Fund's net asset value in such month.

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are officers and directors of
Davis-Dinsmore.

NOTE 3 - PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

At April 30, 2007 there were 5,733,016 shares of beneficial interest
outstanding, with a par value of $0.01 per share. During the six months ended
April 30, 2007, 107,882 shares were issued in connection with reinvestment of
dividends from net investment income, resulting in an increase in paid-in
capital of $2,097,228.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $53,237,539 and $52,797,459, respectively, for the six months ended
April 30, 2007.

A distribution of $0.21 per share from net investment income was declared on
May 15, 2007, payable June 28, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of
business June 14, 2007.

                                                                         Page 13

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY CONTRACT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The independent trustees of Bancroft renewed the advisory contract with
Davis-Dinsmore Management Company in November 2006. The following are the
material factors and conclusions that formed the basis for that approval.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nature and extent of the advisory services provided by Davis-Dinsmore --
The Board (the "Board") of the Fund and the independent trustees reviewed the
services to be provided by Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory Agreement. The
Board noted that under the Advisory Agreement, Davis-Dinsmore would supervise
all aspects of the Fund's operations including the investment and reinvestment
of cash, securities or other properties comprising the Fund's assets. In this
regard, the Board noted that under the Advisory Agreement it is Davis-Dinsmore's
responsibility to, among other things, (a) supervise all aspects of the
operations of the Fund; (b) obtain and evaluate pertinent information about
significant developments and economic, statistical and financial data, domestic,
foreign or otherwise, whether affecting the economy generally or any industry or
the Fund or any issuer of securities held or to be purchased by the Fund; (c)
determine which issuers and securities shall be represented in the Fund's
investment portfolio and regularly report thereon to the Board; (d) place orders
for the purchase and sale of securities for the Fund; and (e) take, on behalf of
the Fund, such other action as may be necessary or appropriate in connection
with the above.

Based on such review, both the Board and the independent trustees concluded that
the range of services to be provided by Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory
Agreement was appropriate and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is providing
services in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

The quality of services provided by Davis-Dinsmore -- In reviewing the
qualifications of Davis-Dinsmore to provide investment advisory services, both
the Board and the independent trustees reviewed the credentials and experience
of Davis-Dinsmore's investment personnel who will provide investment advisory
services to the Fund, and considered Davis-Dinsmore's (i) portfolio and product
review process, particularly its adherence to the Fund's investment mandate,
(ii) compliance function and its culture of compliance, (iii) use of technology,
including the use, from time to time, of direct satellite links to issuer
interviews and conferences, (iv) investment research operations (which involves
meetings with issuers and analysts, investment seminars and field trips to
issuers, and the review of: (a) financial newspapers, industry literature,
publications and periodicals, (b) research materials prepared by others, (c)
issuer annual reports and prospectuses, and (d) issuer press releases) and
trading operations (which involves computerized execution of orders), and (v)
focus on providing quality services while keeping the Fund's fees and expenses
as low as possible. The Board and the independent trustees also took into
consideration the presentations made by Davis-Dinsmore at prior Board meetings
pertaining to its management of the Fund.

Based on the review of these and other factors, both the Board and the
independent trustees determined and concluded that the quality of services to be
provided by Davis-Dinsmore was appropriate and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is
providing satisfactory services to the Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Advisory Agreement.

The performance of the Fund relative to comparable funds -- Both the Board and
the independent trustees reviewed the performance of the Fund (at net asset
value) during the past one, three, five and ten years ended September 30, 2006
against the performance of other closed-end funds categorized to be in the
Fund's peer group by Lipper, Inc. Both the Board and the independent trustees
noted that the Fund's performance for the one, three and five year periods was
below the average performance of all closed-end funds in the peer group, but was
above the average performance of such funds for the ten year period. In
evaluating the Fund's performance against other funds in its peer group, the
Board and the independent trustees took into account the fact that many of the
Fund's competitors engage in leverage, which has increased their returns, but
that the Fund does not engage in leverage. In addition, the Board and the
independent trustees recognized that many of the Fund's competitors have

Page 15

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY CONTRACT (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a higher percentage of their assets invested in securities with lower credit
quality than does the Fund, and that such securities have performed better than
higher quality securities in recent years. The Board and the independent
trustees also noted that the portfolio manager's investment approach is to make
equity investments utilizing convertible securities to provide a total return
similar to that of equity securities, but with lower volatility and higher
income. The Board and the independent trustees recognized that only three of the
funds in the Fund's peer group followed a similar investment approach. Because
of the differences in how funds in the Fund's peer group are managed, the Board
and the independent trustees concluded that they should consider the performance
of the Fund against appropriate indices as a more relevant factor in assessing
the performance of the Fund.

The performance of the Fund relative to indices -- Both the Board and the
independent trustees reviewed the performance of the Fund (at net asset value)
during the past one, three, five and ten years ended September 30, 2006 against
the performance of the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index and Merrill Lynch
Investment Grade Convertibles Index. Both the Board and the independent trustees
noted that, for the one, three, five and ten year periods, the Fund's
performance was below the Merrill Lynch All Convertibles Index. The Board and
the independent trustees also considered the fact that currently a majority of
the securities held by the Fund have an investment grade rating or are of
comparable quality to securities with investment grade ratings, and noted that,
for the one, three, five and ten year periods, the Fund's performance was above
the Merrill Lynch Investment Grade Convertibles Index.

Based on this review and taking into account all of the other factors that the
Board and the independent trustees considered in determining whether to continue
the Advisory Agreement, the Board and the independent trustees concluded that no
changes should be made to the Fund's investment objective or policies, or the
portfolio management team.

Meetings with the Fund's portfolio manager and investment personnel -- Both the
Board and the independent trustees noted that they meet regularly with the
Fund's portfolio manager and investment personnel, and believe that such
individuals are competent and able to carry out their responsibilities under the
Advisory Agreement.

Overall performance of Davis-Dinsmore -- After considering the overall
performance of Davis-Dinsmore in providing investment advisory and
administrative services to the Fund, both the Board and the independent trustees
concluded that such performance was satisfactory.

Fees relative to those of clients of Davis-Dinsmore with comparable investment
strategies -- Both the Board and the independent trustees noted that the Fund
and Ellsworth Fund Ltd. (the "Funds") are the only clients of Davis-Dinsmore,
and that the advisory fee rates for the Funds are the same. Both the Board and
the independent trustees concluded that, because the fee rates are the same for
the Funds, the current advisory fee rate of the Fund was fair as compared to the
rate for Ellsworth Fund Ltd.

Fees relative to those of comparable funds with other advisors -- After
reviewing the advisory fee rate for the Fund against the advisory fee rates for
funds advised by other advisors in the Fund's peer group both the Board and the
independent trustees determined that the Fund's advisory fee rate was at
approximately the median of the funds in its peer group, and concluded that the
current advisory fee rate of the Fund was fair and reasonable.

BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY CONTRACT (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expense limitations and fee waivers -- Both the Board and the independent
trustees noted that, although there are no contractual expense limitations or
fee waivers in effect for the Fund, Davis-Dinsmore is very diligent in its
efforts to keep expenses of the Fund as low as possible. Both the Board and the
independent trustees also noted that the cost of compliance with regulatory
initiatives was increasing. Both the Board and the independent trustees
concluded that the current level of expenses for the Fund were fair and
reasonable.

Breakpoints and economies of scale -- Both the Board and the independent
trustees reviewed the structure of the Fund's advisory fee under the Advisory
Agreement, and noted that the fee includes one breakpoint when the Fund's assets
reach $100 million. Both the Board and the independent trustees noted that
breakpoints had become effective for the Fund as a result of the Fund's rights
offering that occurred during the 2004 fiscal year, which resulted in lower
management fee expenses as a percentage of assets. Both the Board and the
independent trustees concluded that the Fund's fee levels under the Advisory
Agreement therefore reflect economies of scale and that it was not necessary to
implement any further changes to the structure of the advisory fee for the Fund.

Profitability of Davis-Dinsmore -- Both the Board and the independent trustees
reviewed information concerning the profitability and financial condition of
Davis-Dinsmore. In particular, the Board reviewed Davis-Dinsmore's financial
statements including its statement of income and retained earnings, statement of
cash flows, and audited balance sheet. The Board also reviewed Davis-Dinsmore's
costs in providing services to the Funds. The Board noted that Davis-Dinsmore's
sole source of revenue was fees from the Funds for providing advisory and
administrative services to the Funds. The Board and the independent trustees
noted that Davis-Dinsmore's operations remain profitable and that increasing the
success of the Funds will positively impact Davis-Dinsmore's profitability.

Based on the review of the profitability of Davis-Dinsmore and its financial
condition, both the Board and the independent trustees concluded that the
compensation to be paid by the Fund to Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory
Agreement was not excessive.

Benefits of soft dollars to Davis-Dinsmore -- Both the Board and the independent
trustees discussed the fact that there are no third-party soft dollar
arrangements in effect with respect to the Fund. Both the Board and the
independent trustees recognized that Davis-Dinsmore does receive proprietary
research from brokers with whom it executes portfolio transactions on behalf of
the Fund. This research is used by Davis-Dinsmore in making investment decisions
for the Fund. Both the Board and the independent trustees also considered
representations made by Davis-Dinsmore that portfolio transactions received best
execution. Because such research ultimately benefits the Fund, the Board and the
independent trustees concluded that it was appropriate to receive proprietary
research.

Davis-Dinsmore's financial soundness in light of the Fund's needs -- Both the
Board and the independent trustees considered whether Davis-Dinsmore is
financially sound and has the resources necessary to perform its obligations
under the Advisory Agreement, and concluded that Davis-Dinsmore has the
financial resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory
Agreement.

Historical relationship between the Fund and Davis-Dinsmore -- In determining
whether to continue the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, both the Board and the
independent trustees also considered the prior relationship among Davis-Dinsmore
and the Fund, as well as the independent trustees' knowledge of Davis-Dinsmore's
operations, and concluded that it was beneficial to maintain the current
relationship, in part, because of such knowledge. Both the Board and the
independent trustees also reviewed the general nature of the non-investment
advisory services currently performed by Davis-Dinsmore, such as administrative
services, and the fees received by Davis-Dinsmore for

                                                                         Page 17

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

performing such services. In addition to reviewing such services, both the Board
and the independent trustees also considered the organizational structure
employed by Davis-Dinsmore to provide those services. Based on the review of
these and other factors, both the Board and the independent trustees concluded
that Davis-Dinsmore was qualified to provide non-investment advisory services to
the Fund, including administrative services, and that Davis-Dinsmore currently
is providing satisfactory non-investment advisory services to the Fund.

Other factors and current trends -- Both the Board and the independent trustees
considered the culture of compliance and high ethical standards at
Davis-Dinsmore, and the efforts historically and currently undertaken by
Davis-Dinsmore to engage in best practices. Both the Board and the independent
trustees noted Davis-Dinsmore's historical adherence to compliance procedures,
as well as the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions. Both the
Board and the independent trustees concluded that this commitment to adhere to
the highest ethical standards was an important factor in their determination
that they should approve the continuance of the Advisory Agreement for the Fund.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After considering all of the above factors and based on informed business
judgment, the Board determined that the Advisory Agreement is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders and that the compensation to
Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory Agreement is fair and reasonable. As a result,
the Board continued the Advisory Agreement.

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of May 23, 2007 an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the officers of Bancroft Fund Ltd. (the

Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of the Registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 30a-3(c)
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as amended. Based on that
evaluation, the Registrant's officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded
that, as of May 23, 2007, the Registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that material information
relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and PFO as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the Registrant's internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the

likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
